1jqts5i,"At what point does depression turn into self-harm and suicidal ideation, how bad does my mental state have to get?","I was diagnosed with moderate depression and anxiety recently, as someone in their early adolescence, actively having 2 therapy sessions weekly, prescribed Fluoxetine. 

In comparison to the majority of people on this platform, my condition is most likely not even worth mentioning, quite frankly, since it isn't that bad, but I still wanted to get an outside perspective.

Generally speaking, I am not concerned about attempting self-harm or committing suicide currently. At least, not yet. My mental health is deteriorating, so it might worry me in the foreseeable future, but I have so far never gotten any thoughts of harming myself or ending it all. 
 Please offer me advice or opinions on what to do moving forward.

Here are my symptoms:

Excessive guilt, Reminiscing the past, Lack of motivation, Overthinking, Binge eating, Always tired, Intrusive thoughts, Low self-esteem, Highly sensitive to criticism or anything deemed less than perfect, and Easily tearful.

Hormones and stress are also causes for some of these, not just depression, but I believe there is at least a somewhat correlation between these signs and my worsened depression.

At the end of the day, I am just a kid trying to fix my issue before adulthood arrives, so any assistance or support y'all can offer is much appreciated by me.
Thank you very much.

1ja24gj,ive lost my will to live,"at this point i feel like the most logical thing for me to do is to kill myself. ive felt this way for so many years and im sick of it.

ive always been the 'strong' 'happy' 'funny' friend. when my friends cry im there to support them, and i often focus on making sure everyone around me is laughing, because if im not wasting my energy making someone laugh or helping them out, im back to my own sad little world. i feed off of peoples energy, and i use it to fake my way through every single day. 

i used to journal and tell my best friend everything, and she would make me feel better, and hold me when i cry. but now she doesnt even do that anymore, she's got her own problems so i keep to myself to not be a burden. even when i am up front or open, i dont feel like she cares about me at all.

i dont have a job, i cant drive. i am so lazy, all i ever do is rot in my disgusting room. my bed reeks and so do i, my hair is greasy and knotted, and my teeth are yellow. i struggle to get out of bed, even when it's to do something i would usually enjoy. i dont even have a hobby, im too tired to put effort into anything.

i live with my parents and they constantly pick me apart. they make fun of me. i dont even think they like me. i often hear my mother complaining about me on the phone, about my room and even how i smell. my father is an angry man and yells at me for every little mistake i make. even when i try to sleep to escape it all, they wake me up and make fun of me for acting ""all depressed"" my mother divorced my biological father when i was very young and he left me 4 years ago 

ive been struggling with self-harm and suicidal ideation since forever. my fingernails are often bitten down and bleeding. when i break down or get angry i pull out my own hair , hit my own head repetedly until it is bruised and swollen, or bite my hands/arms. i have even resorted to cutting and burning. 

school was my escape, but ive been falling behind in all my classes. i used to preform decently in school, but i just don't have the energy anymore. i go to a small school, and my teachers dont even pay attention to me. ive been arguing a lot with my best friend lately about nothing and she doesn't like a lot of the things i do, making disgusted faces at me frequently. she even gets onto me like my parents do. every time we argue its my fault. between school and home i probably get into 4+ arguments a week. i mess eveythingup.

i can't get help. i cant do therapy or get medication because of my parents. i dont see this ever any getting better, and i cant even tell anybody how i really feel. ive been researching suicides and suicide-by-cop so i can make a plan. ive been trying to convince myself for months that this is the right thing to do, but im scared. i don't want to die, i just feel so swallowed whole by everything, and there is no way to make the pain stop.

1jphqu0,“Just a little depression”,"This is just a useless rant. But I feel like I have no one to talk to…To be honest I feel so empty inside. I haven’t felt this bad In years, the constant thoughts of checking out early is on my mind. My self esteem and self worth are at an all time low. I’ve been telling my wife I need help.. I can’t bring myself to make the appointment. She told me I need to be an adult. According to her I’m suffering from a little depression. Coming from someone who has just as bad mental health as I. I feel so alone.. and un herd. This time I’m asking for help, and being overlooked.. I’ve never asked for help before.. and this is exactly why. So now she is asleep cuddling her ex in the bed next to me (we are poly) and I’m awake thinking about self harm and suicide. She has given me a month before she leaves me to change.. she seems so much more happier with her ex then she has with me in a long time. Even our son said the same. I’m such a complete failure. In every aspect. I’m literally a burden on everyone in my life. They would all be better without me. Maybe if I wasn’t on this earth anymore she could finally be happy. Maybe her ex could treat her better than me. I’m just so exhausted mentally and physically. I haven’t really eaten the last 3 days or hardly slept. She told me I’ve hurt her this last few weeks for not adulting enough I guess. But I’ve never said half the things she has said to me. Never once threatened to leave her, no matter how she treated me. Just two days ago I was her soulmate. She saved me from killing my self 5 years ago when I met her. I even let her delete the suicide note I had on my phone pre planned. Maybe it’s time I re write it. Let’s be honest at this point I’m just a shell of a person and always in the way. It’s pointless. I feel like I’m never enough for her, or for anyone for that matter. I made the choice to stay at a job I hate for the security of it, over a job that I would love and make more. She always complains we are broke. But I spend my last dollar on her if she wants something. Idk even why I’m here. I guess it’s better than crying.

I dont want to kill myself because nobody would care, i dont want to live because nobody would care. 

I dont even fucking know. I cant seem to understand my own feelings and this probably makes fuckall sense but damn am i depressed. I dont know why, i dont know why im just down so much. I cant get girls anymore, i get picked on when i used to be the cool popular person, im just a fucking loser when last year i was ontop of the world and i took it all for fucking granted. Im so selfish and ignorant. Im not fishing for some suckup “aw itll all workout” because itll only get worse from here. I just hate myself in a way and i just want to be loved. I AM loved and i know that but i mean intimately loved. Like i want to be hugged by a girl. I just want a real friend i can talk to. I just want to be loved man. 

Recently, i have a nephew (4M) and his dad (my brother, 29M) and mother (20+F) split up a while back. To cut a long story short shes involved with gangs, drugs and horrible living conditions not fit for my nephew. He was living with us for a while but needed to go to school. We sent him to my primary school. We put regulations in place so he could stay safe. He get taken by his mum and we dont know where he is and we havent seen him since. Im only a kid and i dont get told enough and i really worry. Thats something that gets me down and i have nobody to talk to about it. I was speaking to a girl 2 weeks ago too. Really sweet really nice girl. We planned to meet up again but after we went back to school after the holidays shes been really dry and not messaging. We were supposed to meet at her place last weekend but she cancelled and shes about to cancel this weekend too. I have nobody. My dad wont speak to me. I have nobody real friends and my mum wouldnt litsen or help. I just want to be loved. If you actually took the time out of your day to read my problems i appreciate you so much, May God bless you ❤️🙏

1jmzwlc,i need help.,"i’m young and he was my first boyfriend, my first kiss, first everything. it’s been 8 months and i can’t move on. he’s on his second girlfriend since me and i’m falling apart.

i was the one who did the breaking, and it was an accident. i was struggling really hard with bad and intrusive thoughts that led to self-harm and destruction, and i called him over to tell him, and hopefully get some help and support.

instead, the words “i can’t do this anymore…” came out of my mouth and i’ve been spiralling downwards ever since. nothing is helping. i can’t be his friend, i can’t go no contact.

i seriously thought i was getting better until i went alone to a school dance last night, and he had his girlfriend as his date and they were dancing and smiling and making out, while i got drunk.

it hurts so bad. i’ve fallen back into a depression and i can’t tell anyone, they won’t support me. i need advice. help. anything. i want to get over him because the pain is getting a bit overwhelming. please help me.",2025-03-30 03:00:26,3,5,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jmzwlc/i_need_help/,need help .,0.187,0.68,0.134,-0.91,moderate

1jr78fc,Taking a break from depressed friend,"I just said I needed a break from my close friend with depression.
A lot of things have happened relentlessly, one after the other, without much space for me to recover properly. I'm burnt out in this relationship. 

My friend and I very close, essentially best friends, and love talking to each other. He struggles immensely with a myriad of things - depression, OCD, anxiety, PTSD. He has in the 4-5 years of knowing him. He's intermittedly gone in and out of depression holes. In the earlier years he's struggled with self harm and a suicide attempt. It's been consistently taxing on me, where each phase he goes through is another better but still unstable place. Especially in the last couple of years since he came back from travelling, he's been really lost with who he is and what he wants to do. Currently he's been unemployed for 3 months and struggling to find energy to get a job or even just do the basics sometimes.

Between his on and off again attempts at living and turning into a blob, and my anxiety, it's all excruciating. I'm sick of constantly reckoning with the fact that he might leave (I think this is partly my anxiety, but there's also been a history of his disappearing for days to a week. He's been getting better but it's still not enough). Regardless of the rationality of the threat, it feels like a constant threat hanging over me nonetheless. And to be honest, I don't have faith anymore that he will be able to get to a decent place. Or at least I'm so burnt out that I don't have the energy to. I don't have faith that he won't leave. I don't have any reserves of hope for his future. It's just not something my body is able to believe in right now.

I'm frustrated that my pain is not able to be voiced or done anything about to him. I know support for supporting him shouldn't come from him, and I'd obviously never say these things to his face, but it aggravates me that all this suffering won't be seen by him when he's partly to ""blame"" for it. It feels like I just have to sit in my anxiety mostly by myself, like sitting in mud, alone. That this is my burden and nothing can really be done about it. It's just a bad situation mixed with my own abandonment issues.

I'm disappointed that I've failed to keep my own boundaries and protect myself. I thought I was getting better but I've still managed to get to this place, making the same core mistake that I've done in the past of overextending and not being careful enough with my energy. I feel like I won't be able to healthily be there for him any time in the near future, but I'm trying not to think about that right now.

Sorry this was a bit of a rant and emotional dump, but in other news and in terms of what I can control and give to myself - I'm trying to talk more about my own suffering and through my own experience of anxiety and abandonment feelings to friends and on here. I'm going to just take the time to relax and bring it back to my own foundations and not have to worry about supporting or something happening. It's also a good space to reanalyse and realise mistakes and what is misaligned in my own perception.

I hope this is the start of properly doing better for myself. Thank you for reading.",2025-04-04 11:46:39,3,4,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jr78fc/taking_a_break_from_depressed_friend/,taking break depressed friend,0.177,0.706,0.117,-0.9928,moderate
1jlvc4x,All my (20M) Friends (19F-20F) abandoned me and I need help,"

TW: Suicidal thoughts, drug use, self harm

For years I've struggled making friends. I just never thought people really understood me and found it really hard to be myself with others given i have social anxiety and self worth issues. This was until around 7 months ago, when I met a group of people who I genuinely thought I got along really well with, and who became really close to over the last 7 months. Even just 3 days ago, I felt extremely secure in my friendships, I had plans with the group coming up, and many people from the group had even been contacting me trying to initiate 1 on 1 plans (which is really rare and special for me). This was until yesterday, when they all mass blocked me on every platform imaginable. I have no idea why and as far as I'm aware ive done nothing wrong. 

Since this ive been at the worst point in my life, contemplating suicide, abusing substances and self harming. I have no idea what to do and am just at a loss. I've tried contacting my doctor to get help as soon as possible because im scared of what I might do to myself but I havent been able to see her yet. 

What can I do to get them back? I just need any kind of advice or words I can get i feel so lonely and worthless.

 I don't know if I wish I was dead sometimes, I don't know if I wish I was alive sometimes... I guess I just want to feel appreciated? Or just something that will change my outlook on life and people. It sucks having to pretend to be mentally okay.

1jsd6pb,I need advice,"15M, diagnosed by the doctor with OCD, anxiety, depression, ADHD. I was born into a family that met and got married within 3-4 months after birth control pills didn't work (I don't blame them for that, my birth was an unpredictable outcome). Normally they would break up within a few months, but my birth created a home that shouldn't have been created and condemned them to each other. Over time, their fights were reflected on me and caused irreversible consequences on my face (physical scars), and my hyperactive behavior and adjustment problems made them even angrier. Although their relationship has improved a little, I still feel like I'm sabotaging their relationship. I can't have a proper conversation with anyone in my daily life because I constantly feel like I'm physically and psychologically harming someone. I feel like I'm responsible for everything that happens in the family. Especially recently, I feel like it would be good for everyone if I ended my existence as it should be. I can't stand the fact that I shouldn't exist anymore and that I was born as a result of a mistake. I feel like my life, which shouldn't exist anyway, is constantly harming someone and that this is really unbearable. I can't tell the doctor these things because I'm afraid he'll put me in the hospital.

1jse8rz,I'm my own worst critic,"I’m not satisfied with where I am in life – I once became a shut-in and let three years of education slip me by, and I’m now paying the price. I can’t get a summer job, I’m just an average student with average intelligence, barely passing some subjects. I’ve been alive for 20 years and have nothing to show for it. My ambitions amount to nothing and remain mere distractions. I want to break free from my drab life, but it seems like I don’t have what it takes, despite trying. Pushing myself to go the extra mile feels unrealistic. I’ve tried “locking in,” but it quickly leaves me overwhelmed, disappointed, and burned out.

On the other hand, there are things to appreciate. For instance, I’m physically healthy (as far as I’m concerned), I have my basic needs met, with some leeway for things here and there sometimes. But I’m still socially inept, average, directionless, and often lazy.

Irresponsibly, I’ve used self-harm, nicotine, and alcohol to deal with my ruminative self-hatred — to the point where I’ve spent part of my free time alone in my apartment, smoking, bleeding, puking, and getting blackout drunk. I recently went to psychiatry to find out what the hell was wrong with me. I was transparent with my struggles, but it turns out nothing is “wrong” with me — except for my pre-existing ASD and sleep disorder diagnoses. Which has led me to think that it’s all in my head.

My future looks bleak. Knowing my capabilities, the best I can hope for is to land some boring, run-of-the-mill job in the distant future (if even that), and spend my free time as a mindless consumer. I know I can improve my mental health by practicing good habits — mindfulness, exercise, sleep hygiene, eating well, and spending time with people. Yet all it takes is one bad day for me to start spiraling again, leading to more self-destructive behaviors.

It’s so exhausting — I could be bedrotting, questioning my existence, and wanting to do absolutely jackshit all in one day. And then, the very next day, be up and running, getting tasks done, and seeming completely fine to everyone and myself. In hindsight, most people don’t have it figured out, which is fine — but successful people make me envious and reflective. Seeing their accomplishments makes me yearn for something more. I accordingly attempt to make a change, and come out the other side empty-handed.

1jn4m1x,Hope Post?,"Hi there, I'm going to try to construct this as not just purely sounding like I'm trying to beat my own head in but we'll see how it actually turns out? I promise I'll try to remember to put the hope in there somewhere at the end.

I have depression. Like many, I have found it to be significantly crippling in life. I have nearly made decisions to end my own life a few times, but thankfully I have received some kind of intervention to pull me away from those dark impulses during those moments.

I have been very self-destructive in my depression and have self sabotaged every academic and financial opportunity presented to me. I have purposely failed many classes to absolutely tank my college GPA to make me undesirable because ""that is what I deserve"". 

I have literally gone through the effort of trying again just to fail again so I could ruin my academic transcripts even further. I've taken away second and third chances away from myself because ""that is what I deserve"".

I have such significant self loathing for myself that I have branded myself as a failure and choose to fail because ""that is what I deserve"". 

I choose to isolate myself because of my depressed state and haven't ""really"" seen or spoke to past friends in years. I am ashamed of myself and feel immensely guilty for failing myself and I believe I don't deserve friends or love or happiness or success. I am a failure and choose to live as a loser nobody because ""that is what I deserve"". 

I purposely don't seek help because I believe I should live a sad life because ""that is what I deserve"". 

I'm immensely burdened with self doubt. It's hard to believe in yourself when you define yourself as a failure. It's hard to believe in yourself when you know your mental health can slip. With my history, I'll likely just destroy/self sabotage anything I work towards so it's hard to be motivated to believe I can actually achieve something. 

I have purposely used dangerous substances to harm my body physically because ""that is what I deserve"". 

I'm such a drama lama and I used these negative thoughts and behaviors to keep me in the tiny box I have confined myself to because ""that is what deserve."" 

My software is all messed up. Instead of saying, ""I love you, it's okay to make mistakes"" I say, ""I am a failure, I'm never going to make steps forward. I should give up and end my life "" and all that jazz. 

Man, fuck that. Fuck me, fuck you(I don't mean that), fuck everything. The world I'm currently living in is the reality of my making. Everyday I'm making choices to negatively impact my life. 

I'm not choosing to be depressed but I'm also not choosing not to be depressed. I allow this software of absolute bullshit to continue to run and I need to make choices to update my software. Can I make those choices to get help? Of course. It's never been a matter of ""can"". Anyone who says otherwise is lying to themselves. Will I choose to do it? There is the crux. 

Some days are worse than others. That also means some days are better than others. Big pile of poo verses slightly smaller big pile of poo isn't great. Objectively, less shit is good shit, but still shit. 

I understand that I am depressed and again I'm not choosing to feel this way about myself but I'm not flexible with myself/can't allow myself grace to make better choices. 

I am not forgiving myself for having depression. Which is fucking stupid. Would I blame myself for dementia or schizophrenia or other crazy ass mental health disorders? All the shit I'm feeling is because my ""sad mind cancer"" is telling me bullshit. 

I always felt like life is a boxing match and you are a boxer. Normally you have your coach and corner man there to back you up to help guide you through the rounds. When you have depression it's felt like my coach and conerman went to my opponent and is giving them advice on how to best slip my defense and deck me in the face. 

I'm literally my own arch enemy and it is difficult to want to help and hug my arch enemy. Fuck that guy he is a dumb ass- you know? How can I choose to help myself if I hate myself? 

Right now it feels very difficult to make that choice. I can appreciate that this is a mental health issue but it's just so troubling that I agree with my depression. 

Today, I am trying to appreciate a smaller pile of shit. What are some of the coping mechanisms you use to give yourself some grace?

1jfgjwl,Longest I've gone without falling back into a depressive state. It's a lifelong war,"It's been a few months since I've felt this much hatred for myself. I recently fell sick again and I just cant help but hate living like this. Everyday I have to endure my family, my insecurities and my overall self-loathing. I'm turning 18 this year and it has only made me feel like I've lost my years to depression and anxiety. I'm a high school dropout with no job or skills, I have only one thing that I could possible pursue as a career and I used to love doing it, but I'm even losing interest in that. I stopped visiting the psychiatrist and stopped medication because I felt like it did nothing but exhaust me and make me feel less. Now all I do is rot in bed and wish i had a better life.

I was genuinely doing great for the past few months, but my lack of progress in fixing myself up like trying to put myself together and go out more often is devastating to me. I'm filled with jealousy and rage when I see people, especially girls my age doing great and being so put-together. Everything just felt like I was putting up a front for others subconsciously, but I genuinely felt happy for awhile. I guess my emotions hit me like a train today, and all I can really do is write about it and journal it.

I've vowed to stop putting this energy out into the world and into other people's lives because, at then end of the day, it's not anyone else's responsibility but mine to take care of myself. I just don't know why I relapsed so suddenly today, I don't self-harm or anything, my own mind hurts enough. 

It fills me with so much rage knowing that I'll never be able to truly live without depression, which makes me want to end things here and now. That temporary pain for me and my loved ones would be less than the amount of pain I'd probably bring them if I continued living. Feeling like an absolute burden to everyone. Falling sick every month, can't find a job for the life of me, can't even finish the extra school my parents are paying for (I chose to take a private course to do nails) I am just losing myself. All that on top of my struggle with religion. I truly want to do better, but knowing that I will never fully fulfil the goals I set for myself is what hurts me the most. Knowing that I'll always be fighting this war with depression throughout the rest of my life while I figure out adulthood as well, it all seems so daunting. I'm accustomed to failure at this point, so I don't even bother to pursue the things I love when I know I'll make mistakes or eventually fail.

Just this mind reset today made me realize that I will have to deal with this the rest of my life, despite how great I had been feeling.",2025-03-20 07:07:25,4,5,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jfgjwl/longest_ive_gone_without_falling_back_into_a/,longest ive gone without falling back depressive state . lifelong war,0.178,0.653,0.169,-0.8069,moderate

He was ok and in recovery when we first met, but something seemed to happen around July/August. He also has avoidant attachment style if that helps you understand better. He doesn’t go in detail about what’s going on, which is ok for me, i don’t plan on forcing him to tell me if he’s not comfortable— I love him regardless and i’m sure he must be having a very tough time. There’s this times when we don’t talk, which i’m also okay with not only because i got used to it, but because i know his love isn’t defined by that. I respect his space and i have always been clear that i do not mind if we don’t talk, even if i miss him. I have also noticed he self-harms, which honestly breaks my heart. As a girlfriend, i do not like seeing him in pain, but i know i can’t do much aside from giving him my support. Every time he isolates himself, I leave him some messages (without being overly intrusive) telling him that i love him and that it is ok to have relapses, i always try to remind him how i am proud of him for every single effort he does. He also does the same and tells me that he feels sorry for not giving me what i deserve. I love him too much to be true, i genuinely care for him.

1jpa3e4,My separation anxiety is killing me,"TW: self harm

Hello everyone, I hope you’re well. I’m going to keep this post as short as I can, but I have gone long enough trying to fight this alone that I have turned to you all for support.
I (19F) got extremely attached to an older teacher 9 months ago. I felt safe enough to tell her, and she was very accepting of it. However when I went into the next school year she stopped teaching me, and I only see her in the hallway maybe twice a week. I cannot express how much this has affected me since I left her - my thought patterns are “I can’t live without her” and “what’s the point in doing anything without her” which obviously has led me down a dark path mentally. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this because of fear of judgement. I see her as a mother to me and I seriously struggle to cope when away from school. 
From an outside point of view I can appreciate how silly this sounds, but I have fallen into depression, being diagnosed in early December last year and I am taking antidepressants. However they have not stopped the feelings of hopelessness without her and the ANXIETY. At one point I was having panic attacks several times a week because I panic when I don’t see her, which is pretty much 24/7. I spend my days counting down when I’ll see her again. I haven’t spoken to her in 2 months and I feel like I’m going crazy. The anxiety got so debilitating that I attempted suicide twice and have self harmed more than I would like to because my anxiety only goes away when I am with her - which is never. I’ve considered doing wild things to myself just to get her attention. I have been going to therapy for the past month and my therapist unfortunately told me that he cannot help me because he is not trained in attachment. 
Is anyone able to offer any advice ?

1ji74eu,"I don't want to live, but I want to live","So I have been on reddit for quite a long time but this is my first time creating a post.

I am so frustrated with my life to the point I do not know what to do. I’m only 15, but everything just feels pointless. The main reason I feel this way is school. I live in Poland, and I’ve always hated the school system. Don't get me wrong - I always loved to learn, try new things and subjects but school just exhausts me to the point I want to end my life.

When I was younger (maybe 7/8 years old) I was heavily bullied by the entire class. They stole my things, called me names, laughed at me, even hurt me. The teachers did nothing and my mother had to put me in different school. This helped a little but I was still traumatized. I always was afraid to talk with anyone and this hasn’t changed even after so many years.

I don’t have friends and I sit alone all day. Besides that I think we are taught nothing in school (at least in my country, because I know it is a common problem here). All I can remember from the years I spent in school is sitting in one place for 8 hours a day, being bored, learning something just because I need to get a grade and forget it.

I have many other hobbies and interests and school just seems like a huge waste of time. I have questioned it forever. Why? For who? Why we can’t just learn important things and (most importantly) skills needed in everyday life?

I am so angry at myself every time I have to sit quietly and ‘read the topic from the book’ because the teacher has a headache when I could go out for a walk, read a book about something that I like or even do something creative! For most of the school hours we are just forced to sit quietly and do stuff ourselves. I can’t even count how many times a teacher has just played a video instead of actually teaching us. Like… it is your job!

All English I know, I learned from the Internet, games and movies. Most of my friends struggle to even read things properly because our teacher can’t so won’t teach them. I don’t want to brag and I am absolutely not blaming them. I feel sorry for them and wish everyone could just get it at some point. It is just an example.

I also wanted to mention that I used to self-harm for a really long time (since I was about 10 years old). I stopped doing it about a half a year ago. I don’t want to make myself a victim but I just haven’t told anyone ever and wanted to include that because I don’t know if it might impact some of my thoughts, experiences and opinions.

The thought of having to sit in school for at least another two years disgusts me, and sometimes I just want it all to end right there, right here. I know this might sound stupid but because of my everyday life in school, I can’t stand even looking at books and holding a pen in my hand (good thing I have the option to write everything on my computer). I know this isn’t the most important thing in the world, but it bothers me so much, and I have no idea how to fix it. I used to love read books and in my free time I read so many of them but I must admit – for the last year I have barely read one book. I know it’s pathetic, but it’s my reality, and I’m ashamed to admit it.

I desperately want it to end but I don’t want to kill myself just because of that and I know I couldn’t do that because I am a coward. I just wanted to share that for so long and I think it might be the right place.",2025-03-23 22:13:50,3,4,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ji74eu/i_dont_want_to_live_but_i_want_to_live/,"dont want live , want live",0.125,0.761,0.114,-0.9511,high

1jhncbk,i’m 15 and want to die,"this is my first post so sorry if it's all over the place!

i'm 15 years old and have been struggling mentally for about a year and a half. it started freshman year when i started to skip school a lot, and i been a lot like at least once a week. i would skip school for many reasons like because i had sleeping problems. i'd had sleeping problems since 7th grade and could sleep without some kind of sleeping medicine. another reason i would skip is because i just simply didn't have the engergy. i didn't have the energy to get up in the morning then i didn't have enough to get up at all and i would bed rot for days. another reason is because i have a lot going on in my head i often think back into my childhood which wasn't good with my parents being split up and being abused in almost every way. i ended up failing algebra and had to take it again this year. which makes me feel stupid because i didn't fail because i'm dumb i failed because i never went to school and did my work. i'm also extremely shy and anxious so when i would go back to school and class that i missed a bunch of i would get worked up and have panic attacks. On top of that i only have like 3 friends maybe. i've never been social or good at making friends (i've been friends with all of them since i was a kid). at the beginning of second semester of freshman year i had to talk to a probation officer about my absences and was almost put on probation, but i kept missing school. even after being threatened with probation, cps, and juvie i continued to skip. I HATE SCHOOL AND ANYTHING ABOUT IT. when sophomore year started last fall it started good. i was somewhat happy with my classes and wasn't skipping a lot. my school has a rule that if you miss 4 or less days you don't have to take finals and every semester i strived to miss less the 4 days but of school that never happened until last fall i had miss 4 days so i could miss anymore and one day in november i skipped again. then it all started again i started skipping a lot again and my grades slipped and when school ended my mom signed me up for online school. i started doing online school in january but never really did it (idk why i just couldn't). and eventually i was kicked out of online and for the past month i haven't gone to school at all and i've just been laying in my room feeling depressed. i've fucked myself for life with what i've done to myself. i'll probably never be able to come back from this academically or mentally and honestly feel like there no reason for me to go on. if i can't even go to school or do my work then i'll never be able to have a job or work. my whole life i've felt like somethings wrong with me. when i was little my dad loved my stepmom or than me i felt unlovable and developed self esteem issues at a very young age. i've always felt ugly and boys never have really showed interest in me, rather people around me. i also feel dumb from failing classes but because all my friends are very smart (my best friend is top of the class) so i have always felt pressured. also i have 2 cousin that are in my grade who do really well academically and athletically so my grandma i live with is always comparing me to them. i used to be so happy and do well in school and i even played sports. i played softball for 8 years but eventually my mental health got in the way of that as well. mental illnesses run in my family and so does addiction so i've been doomed since before i was born. i've suspected that  im mentally ill for a while (since i've always felt like something's wrong with me) and i think i might have depression. i sit in my room all day by myself, because that's the only way i'm happy. i'm only happy when i'm alone or so that's what i thought but i'm starting to think that's just what i'm used to and i've just adapted to that feeling and think its happiness. (i hope that makes sense). But truly the only way i'm happy is when i'm high and i'm not trying to sound like a pothead, but i've been smoking since i was 13 so it's became a coping mechanism i guess. also weed is the only thing that helps me sleep so when i did go to school i would have to get violently hugh ever night just to be able to sleep. i tried to start self harming when i was 12 but could never bring myself to cut myself, making me feel like a pussy. when i was 14 is when i actually started self harming. i would burn myself with cigarettes and still do it to this day. almost 2 years later and nobody has ever noticed. NOT A SINGLE SOUL HAS NOTICED SCARS OF MY ARMS AND LEGS. i'm starting to think i should burn myself in more noticeable places so people will notice and actually believe that i'm struggling and not a lazy failure. a call of help i guess but i don't want to seem like an attention seeker. and i think i might be starting to get addicted to it because i like the way it feels and the scars. since i've been out of school in december i've started eating less because i don't eat lunch at school anymore. i don't eat breakfast or lunch and hardly ever eat dinner. i usually just eat a snack once or twice a day or sometimes nothing at all. i've actually lost over 10 pounds because of this and i weight about 80 something pounds now and the bmi says i'm underweight. like i said earlier i struggle with self esteem issues so i don't like that way i look. i've been extremely skinny my whole life and was often praised for it as a kid, so now it's nailed in my head i have to been skinny and petite. when i was a little kid i was short, skinny, blonde, blue eyed, and had a perfect smile thanks to my fake teeth. i'm starting to think i might be anorexic or am developing it because on top of loosing that weight i have also lost my appetite and often have to force myself to eat. my period have became irregular and almost didn't have one last month, which i know happens when someone is anorexic. i spend a lot of time in the mirror looking at myself, and i hate how i look. thin lips, dead dyed hair, dark circles, bad skin, crooked teeth, everything. i also spend alot of time looking at my body. i hate how flat i am but also love being skinny. i know this isn't nice but i'm scared to become fat and often see myself bigger then i am. i only feel skinny when i can see my ribs poking through my skin, but i hate how skinny my legs and arms are. i find myself caking on tons of makeup just to feel a bit pretty. i hate my smile because my teeth are crooked. as i little kid i had to get caps on my real teeth because they were rotting or something. my teeth were perfectly straight and SO WHITE, but now are just crooked and yellowish. i haven't been to the dentist in 8 or 9 years and i have cavities i think. when i was a kid my dad enjoyed pulling my teeth out for some weird reason so as i got older i stopped talking about my teeth period with anyone and i didn't even touch my loose teeth. i would let them fall out on their of or wait for the new tooth the grow above it, creating crowding with my teeth. now i'm almost 16 and haven't even lost all my teeth yet. 

i've tried talking to people but nobody understands me. i've never met anyone who's gone through the same things as me. none of friends growing up and now didn't have split parents, none of them were abused, or lived in a dysfunctional household. not even my parents or siblings understand cause they didn't go through it. anytime i try and talk about how i'm feeling to my mom or grandma they just bring up school and remind me that i'm a failure. i've been asking to go to the doctor for over a year and they say they'll take me but they never do, no matter how much i've cried,begged, and pleaded...literally. i have broke down in tear multiple times just begging for help and nobody does anything. Nobody has really ever asked me what's wrong or something like that. not friends. not teachers. not even my family. i feel so lost and different from everyone else and i just want help. im actually starting to blame my mom for that way i am. because if she just took me to the doctors like she promised i probably wouldn't be writing this right now. i don't know what to do anymore help or a doctor is not and option anymore and i can't talk to anyone. i tried to kill myself last year but absolutely it didn't work and i've been contemplating suicide again for a while now. i'm never gonna be anything or do anything in life so i feel like there's no point. everyday i live just feels like a chore at this point and i'm tired of vacuuming the same spot everyday if you know what i mean.

so i guess i'm coming to reddit or help or answers. if you have questions i'd be happy to answer them. i honestly have no idea what to do with myself.

1jov3g4,I feel like I’m killing myself,"I never wanted to admit that I might have depression. I do struggle with anxiety. There was also a time in my life I wanted to end it all (14-17). I’m 19 now and I’m doing better than ever. Not really tho bc I can’t bring myself to do anything. Maybe I’m exaggerating I do things but with no energy. I force myself. 

I only feel alive when I’m at work or see my friends that’s where I feel like I’m actually doing something and have a purpose but at home I’m all alone in my room bedrotting. I’ll watch one show and then another one…I’ll spend so much time on my phone until my eyes can’t take it anymore bc most of the times I’m filled with anxiety and kinda freeze. I’m not sad but I could be happier. When I lived back home I’d bottle up my emotions so much and then one night everything would explode and I’d cry myself to sleep. I don’t cry often anymore. Not because I bottle up but just bc I don’t feel like it and like I said I’m not sad. I’m just numb? That’s why I’m kinda glad I have flatmates not that we talk a lot but if I lived all alone it would be much worse. 

My room can get messy but I always clean it up and I do have happy moments. But I still feel meh. And I’m seeing how it’s harming me and I thought I wasn’t depressed anymore but my actions are killing me. It can be so hard to do the easiest things. I’m only energetic when I’m going somewhere. I do go out by myself too but I’m broke rn. Today was almost another water day but I managed to change and now I have to force myself to clean my room and wash my clothes.

1jft428,I'm really at a loss right now,"Idk, tw: self harm, attempted suicide, idk, this subreddit is full of people who think the same but idk if I have to warn, sorry.

I slit my arm open not to long ago, I've cut myself but this was wide and deep and didn't stop bleeding until they sewed it up. My mother and sister were with me, but all I did was feel bad they had to see something like that, I regret getting them put of my own fear of dying (I also know seeing me dead would be a lot worse.)

They act like they care but the suicide prevention or whatever name they called the plan was to put guns away, knives, meds, etc. Because I thought of all those methods but they put the knives in our house away, then the knives in my mother's camper (where I was staying) stayed out and then a couple days later she informs me where the handgun is located (and the ammo) and I know this is probably just a slip up but then I find the whole box of medicine bottles is just stuffed into the bathroom cabinet where everyone gets their towels. Idk, I thought maybe they'd take it more seriously than before because this was an action not just words, but I'm not really sure they even think I'll do it.

It's all I've been thinking about, though. I feel like I don't want to die but I also feel like if I leave to get help (I kind of want it, I'm not sure) everyone will realize how easy it is to live without me and just not let me stay here anymore if I goget help. 

I'm 21, I don't have a job at the moment, I can hardly keep my own space clean (not that I have a room, I sleep on the couch), I can't function and the psychiatrist I saw just said to keep on my Adderall, even though that has not helped my depression, anxiety, and OCD like they say it will. I don't have insurance to cover anything either, so even if I want an inpatient stay for a couple days so they can give me something I can't really afford it (I know they will accept no matter what but they can't keep you there forever.) 

They already really dislike me, I wish they didn't and I do try to change I just feel like if I'm still so depressed I can't keep up with the happy, easy-going attitude they want from me. I know they struggle too, so I understand, I just don't understand why they get to have moments of anger at me but I can't express any when they get on me or if I'm really struggling, I know it's no excuse but I'm not screaming at them, I try to avoid them as much as possible yet every interaction we have ends up with them upset with me so I just leave, sometimes I can change the mood but I don't think they care.

I've tried the things the people at the ER told me to do instead of cutting (snap a rubber band or hold ice if the music or hanging out with my dog doesn't work, I legit have no other hobbies.) But I've resorted to using a razor I found I had stashed away again, I even hit myself with the ice (as embarrassing as it is to hit ones self, people don't take that very seriously, so idk I just find it super embarrassing) but it didn't help me enough. I'm too scared to cut like I did before (I know it's a good thing) but I want so badly to hurt myself irreversibly, so there's no time to run to anyone and even if they found me, they'd never get anywhere quick enough, but I'm still scared of dying, I'm scared I'll regret it the moment it happens just like before but as stated, there'd be no time for help at all.

I'm just at a loss for everything, my life is going nowhere and I feel like there's no solving it since I'm the person I am.

I've had internet access since I was 6, I've seen everything since then and I've seen g0re and porn when i was 7, i have an obsession with both of them, I've never gotten restricted from the internet and I've obviously become attached, im bored most of the time and i really don't know what to do but stay on my phone, if im not at school it's always 12 hours and more if i stay up at night, i can't go a day without using my phone unless im doing something that actually entertains me, I've had online friends but I've lied about everything to everyone, I've lied about my parents being died, age, name, country... I pretended to be  different people at the same time because one wasn't enough, at this point i just want to say the truth i can't lie anymore, i moslty started lying cause I'm boring and basic, i have nothing interesting to say about myself and hate myself, 
I started using my phone to escape reality because everyone is so frustrating at times, I live in a village and its terrible, i always isolate myself no matter what, my parents usually came home at 6-7pm, again most of the day im alone and I've gotten used to it, i hate being with people now. there's only around 40 people in our school max. My parents have seen me having online friends yet didn't do anything nor talk about it to me, i love my parents but this makes me feel so neglected even tho there's people who struggle more, they could've stopped everything a while ago. 
I've always suppressed my feelings and acted like they didn't matter, whenever i wanted to talk about my feelings id start crying before even saying the first sentence, i can't help it. I've self harmed before aswell. I have to sexualize myself to feel loved or cared for. 
 
I've always compared myself to girls my age since forever, I feel so big standing next to them and i hate it, i feel like i always had to act grown because of it and never got to be childish or act my age. Another problem is im jealous of everything and anyone, especially my brother. He's extremely social and never shy, he has so many friends to the point i can't count, i don't understand. I'm extremely shy and can't go anymore without someone else with me, im anxious for everything even when there's nothing going on I feel nervous or anxious. It's so bad i cant even ask for help. I get mad easily and annoyed too, i end up saying stuff i never intended too because i probably wasn't thinking straight at the time. 
I've always had problems dealing with stress and usually pushed it away and cried to myself at night and never talked to anybody about my problems, but now life feels unreal, not like a simulation but it just feels so fake as if this isn't my life, I've never been this suicidal or been this close to committing, im starting to give up and i really can't go a day without feeling like this. It feels like torture going through a simple day because of it, i can't remember how life feels without this feeling. I wish i could talk to alot of people about my feelings, but i just can't bring it up and im embarrassed to tell anyone anything irl.

1jrzesm,My antidepressants are working,"I've been feeling so great lately, and wanted to share it somewhere. I, 14F, had recently started taking antidepressants. I'm kind of lucky, since most parents don't recognize depression as something serious in teens, but my mom has BD and wanted to help me out when I told her I was self harming again. So, at first I wasn't sure if it was working, since I was feeling pretty much normal. But one day I didn't take my meds, and I was feeling so shitty, I was thinking of wanting to die literally every second, had a strong desire to cut myself etc. So I ate and took my antidepressant, and almost immediately it went away. Not that my mood was better or anything, but I didn't think of anything bad like this. I'm honestly so glad I finally got help! I was living like this for about 6 years without it, and to think there are people who live way longer with depression and don't treat it seriously.. that's horrible. I also went to psychologists a lot in the past, but they never helped me, I think visiting them only made me feel worse. My depression isn't severe nor slight, I'd say it's mid-ish, well, that's what my mom's psychiatrist friend said. Also, it's way easier for me to do hygiene and everything, unlike the times where I couldn't even move in my bed. Overall, I'm so pleased with the experience.

It’s been getting worse the last 3 years,I’m 22. 
Every birthday fills me with such anguish,sadness, and fear. I kinda made a revelation this last year as to why I feel that way. It’s because I never intended to be 18 or anything higher. I always silently hoped growing up that I would just die. I’ve been suicidal since 5 years old I’d say, like morbid and in a longing to disappear. 
I have fixed my diet, keep an active lifestyle, take my vitamins, hang with friends, lost 73 lbs but I still get these suicidal bouts of depression. My mom has been apologizing a lot and blaming herself, she’s been saying that I’m traumatized because of her and that her parenting is the reason why I’m so fucked up. Which just makes me feel shittier because now my sadness is making her suffer.
So I am a failed project. 
I hate my body, I lost a lot of weight but I’m still a fatass, I don’t give a fuck if I’m healthy in a metabolic way.  I want to be normal, I want to look normal, I want to think and feel normal, I want to be treated normally. But that’s impossible. I’ll never have a normal fucking body. I’ve had a cutting problem for the last 5 years now, I have managed to “cut back” a bit but I still do it 3 times a month. I don’t want people to see my scars but atp why do I even fucking care. My whole body is a fucking self-harm scar, I was trying to eat myself to death all my life. Those stretch marks and loose skin are just as bad or even worse than the razor scars. It’s embarrassing, I want to claw myself out of this miserable and hideous form and just evaporate. I wish I could fry my brain out of this realm and my body could just carry on with out me so my mother and family can not deal with the grief of a death in the family. I’m healthy, but I still look and feel like shit. I take 300mg of “Wellies” and I still feel “unwelly”. They recently put me on mood stabilizers because I get manic on occasion or get really mad at everything. I love being manic though because it makes life feel tolerable and exciting. When I’m manic, everything’s better… until I come back down with 300 dollars less in my wallet…

So have any of you guys felt this way, have you been depressed since childhood? What’s your feelings on being a “ex-binger” if you are one?
At what age do these feelings go away? Will this eventually stop or do “I have to make it stop”? 
I want to get better so I can complete milestones in my life or least try to. I never had a romantic relationship, because how could i possibly “blow”someone when I’m too busy fantasizing about “blowing my brains out”. How could I love someone when I despise myself, why would I allow someone I supposedly love and adore to be with such a venomous/poisonous, disgusting creature. I’m emotionally unable to express my interest in those I fancy because I’m just paralyzed by fear and shame. And when someone possibly reciprocates or shows interest in me I fuck it up because I’m a weirdo, too dumb to notice or they can sense my loser-ness.",2025-03-30 11:50:07,1,2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jn8bb9/sadness_slump/,sadness slump,0.228,0.665,0.108,-0.9992,high
1jgp2ab,I really don’t know what to do anymore. (advice pls),"Hey, to start this off i want to say i’m a 17 year old girl idk if that will help me get my answer but i wanted to preface that. Also i apologize for my writing it all over the place and i dont know how to be coherent ig

Since i was in elementary school (since i was probably 11) i have been depressed and would self harm, nothing terrible just shallow cuts. It felt like it got better when i moved w my dad for middle school, and it did for a while or at least until 8th grade when i got into a messy breakup and had a complete downward spiral :(
It got worse when i was 15, i was running away and drinking and smoking weed since 8th grade but it got more severe coming into high school. 

I’ve been in multiple treatment facilities and 3 long term residential facilities and it feels nothing has helped. None of my medication has helped or anything, I’ve become more closed off and feel as though i think too much and it freaks me out! My parents say i act like a normal girl my age but i know girls my age and they dont act like i do. it’s gotten worse and worse over these few months and i honestly almost every night think about killing myself after i graduate. I dont think i can be a functioning adult, i dont even feel like a real person.. I barely have any friends at all and they are all distant, i dont feel my boyfriend understands me which he tries to. I feel so alienated from everyone ive ever met! 

Ive tried therapy for years but they always say the same shit like “work on your coping skills”, “try not to think so much about what other people think”, “what can you do to solve this?” like i dont fucking know!!! I dont have a coping mechanism and i cant put my emotions into words or visual its just pure agony! My mom tells me when im in my depressed state to calm down and stop thinking about things, but i cant!!! I genuinely dont know what to do i’m so tired of feeling this way, not feeling whole, feeling like im on a whole different planet basically. I just need advice from people who feel the same way i do and how they combat thinking so much, and not knowing who they truly are. please help me :(",2025-03-21 22:20:12,2,2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jgp2ab/i_really_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore_advice_pls/,really dont know anymore . advice pls,0.159,0.738,0.104,-0.9866,moderate

1jovu6f,Feeling depressed as a response to an irrefutably depressing situation. Where is the line drawn between a normal response and clinical depression?,"For context, I’ve spent a decade of my life with a single minded focus to get into med school, got to the finish line with an offer in my hands, but couldn’t accept it because we couldn’t afford it since my family was going through an abrupt and unexpected period of financial hardship. Efforts to find scholarships were unsuccessful and I’ve had to let the offer lapse. 

This experience sent me on a downward spiral towards suicidal ideation. A little dramatic, maybe, but through my adolescence and early adulthood, that goal made up the entirety of my identity. I didn’t know who I was without it. In my formative years as a child, things happened, and I was fixed on the idea that I have to be successful to protect the people that I loved (alongside a genuine passion for med). That was all I wanted to do, all I lived for. And so for a long time, that was all of me, and my needs and my wants were always secondary to this ultimate goal. Naturally, I was entirely lost, with no recognition of who I was without it and at the same time, feeling immensely guilty that I will amount to nothing but a burden to the people I wanted to protect, who still believe in me when I have nothing to show for it. 

I spent most of the last year in a depressive slump. I’d imagine myself climbing out of a window, or wishing the ceiling would collapse on me, or other ways that I can go and finally free myself from what I felt was a meaningless and burdensome existence. Sometimes I refused to eat to feel like I’m still in control of my life. I’d avoid calling my family because it would remind me of how I failed them and because I couldn’t hold it together in front of them, and they didn’t deserve to see that. I’d pendulum swing between frantically trying to find an alternative plan, and trying to sleep my days away because I refused to participate in life. No suicide attempts were made, and I realise this is very much a form of escapism that many people experience. 
 
Through this, I feel like I’ve come to know a depth to myself, or more specifically, my sadness. I’ve become a little numb to it all, and in the instances where I’ve tried to force myself to cry, almost procedurally, just to get the sadness to go away so I can go on with my day, i find that the tears do not come. Instead it sits in my chest pushing outwards on my ribcage and hovering just enough that I will always be on edge for when something finally cracks. Since coaxing it gently doesn’t work, my mind dived to the deep end and entertained self harm as an option for relief, but was able to persuade myself against it. It feels like an amorphous being, a familiar stranger who breaks into your home, eats from your pantry, sleeps in your bed and refuses to leave. It always comes back, at abrupt times, at the slightest trigger, and I now know to expect it when I’ve felt well for too long. 

I can’t afford therapy. So if a lovely stranger were to stumble upon my post, can someone please tell me if this is normal. I mostly understand that I’m experiencing depression, the feeling, not the disorder. I am having an emotional response to an obviously depressing situation. But why does it keep visiting me abruptly, on perfect days when I’m perfectly happy, when I think I’ve made peace with the the fact that things don’t work out like I expect because that is simply in the nature of things. I’m so tired of holding my breath waiting for it to go away. This a personal curiosity, what is the difference between this and clinical depression?

I'm very worried about this friend. He is diagnosed with depression and it very cleary still affects him. He has ghosted me before in the summer of last year, though this is quite normal for him, as he never texts much during breaks. Anyway I moved out recently to go to college, so I have been unable to see him in person. I am currently back in town for semester break and wanted to see him at school. (He is a grade below me). Because of our school system, he will soon not have classes anymore (start of April) and I think it would be worse to show up unannounced at the place he lives in. 

Would it be a good idea for me to check up on him? Or would it be better to leave him alone? For the school thing I'd essentially pick up my younger sibling, to keep our time short, as I dont know if he would be alright with this.

1jrl2g6,Im tired.,"I don't remember the last time I was genuinely happy and stayed that way. All my happiness just comes and goes in brief bursts, and then I'm grounded back to reality.

I hate going through the processes of living. I hate waking up. I hate going to school. I hate talking to people. I hate doing my school work. I hate doing everything. I see no point to anything. 

At the same time, despite seeing no point - I can't give myself a break. I force myself to smile to everyone. I force myself to do well in school. I force myself to wake up and pretend it's all okay. When in reality it's not. 

Everyday I think about suicide. Suicide is at the forefront of my mind everyday. I don't stop thinking about it, even in the moments when I'm happy, when I'm surrounded by my friend - I still feel like I want to jump off a bridge. 

I also have begun to get urges to cut myself. I never used to go deep, but now I actually seek out my knife, blade, or whatever I use to inflict harm upon myself. I prefer the pain over having to deal with anything else. Now, I have started really going deep on my legs, I get injections every 2 weeks on my legs, and it's getting more difficult to hide the marks. 

If I were told I was going to die tommorow. Id be at peace. I wouldn't be tired anymore. It would be euphoric. I genuinely wish to get a terminal disease or something which just gives me a prognosis which is certain death. Either that or I kill myself - but I don't have the balls to do that, so realistically that wont  happen.

1jqzmvw,Over a decade's worth of exhaustion,"I am almost 24 years old, and I am beginning to realize my mental health issues including my depression is not something that goes away on its own more into my adulthood. I have experienced depressive episodes since the age of 11. 

Today I feel defeated because I am so tired of my symptoms. I feel embarrassed because I experience crying fits for seemingly no reason some days. I am ashamed that I wake up in the morning with a sense of existential dread even on days that should be deemed not stressful or good. I have thoughts of harming myself and the idea everything would be better if I was no longer around. I cannot get up some days to do my necessary activities of daily living. It is extremely difficult for me to maintain relationships with new people and even people I care about because my depression puts up a cloudy barrier that is hard to see through to connect with others. Anhedonia feels like the worst thing in the world because what do you mean I can no longer do the things I used to love with my loved ones and feel joy from it?

I have experienced these symptoms for years, and some days I question if it has gotten worse. I have tried a handful of therapists and medications, but nothing seems to keep as the right fit for either. When I was younger, I was told by my family that it is just ""growing pains"" and ""puberty"". Sure, maybe some of it might have been, but I realize now I am stuck with a mood disorder and other fucked up mental issues that will affect me for the rest of my life. It makes me scared because I think to myself what type of life is worth living if I have to keep battling this until I die. I am tired, so so tired. 

Maybe things will get better, but I cannot say for certain because I do not know the future. For now I am here miserable, trying to work my way out of this mess. I am here to vent and maybe make someone else feel less alone in this battle while trying to feel less lonely myself. My support goes out to all who feel similar. A lot of people will never truly understand and sometimes shame you for this disorder. I don't want to live with shame or like this anymore.

1jqx3yp,I don’t feel like I’m a good person,"I’ve had up-and-down depressive episodes ever since I was a kid. I live in a country where mental health is severely stigmatized and it’s very difficult to get antidepressant medication without judgment or professional consequences (i could lose my job) . lately. I’ve been trying to join a gym and exercise to try to improve my energy and mental health, but I just feel like I’m constantly sabotaging and ruining good things for myself. I get trapped in a negative spiral, and I just wonder if I’m doing this because morally I’m not a good person and I don’t feel like I deserve good things so I just ruin it and punish people around me

My boyfriend and I went on a date to go look at some flowers and I got angry at him because I wanted to leave right when he got home, but he kept stalling and joking and acting like he didn’t wanna go because there were too many people , which made me feel like he thinks its a chore to spend time with me. we went to go take pictures and he teased me for taking bad pictures of him, and that just kind of set me into like a negative spiral which ruined the entire day. I don’t know why I do this. I feel like i’m constantly punishing others with my negative thoughts and I’m just a bad person to be around. My boyfriend pretty much said as much yesterday and that maybe I should just accept that I’m a shitty person. I really don’t know what I’m doing here and I’m kind of just word vomiting right now, but he shamed me for getting therapy so I canceled it yesterday. I started self harming about a month ago which I haven’t done since middle school and I think about hanging myself maybe six or seven times a day.  

I don’t feel like I can call the suicide hotline here because I worry that they will keep my phone number and report it to my job or something. So I guess I’m just here looking for some support or something.

Maybe it's because I don't think I can fully engage with stuff, I do things for something to do and whilst it's fun when I'm there, my mind is elsewhere waiting for the thing to be over. The only time I feel fully there is when I'm alone and crying from how much everything hurts.

I don't know how to carry on like this. Two years ago when I was in the aftermath of something traumatic I had more energy than I do now, I had more motivation to 'get better' but now it's gone. Everything I once had that made me feel better no longer does. I quit drinking (again) but have relapsed with self harm, the only thing stopping me from getting worse with that is the fact it's coming up to summer and it doesn't really help anyway. I just want the pain to stop and though I won't realistically do anything drastic, I don't see any other way out, I just want it all to be over.

1jje65l,Childhood trauma hitting hard rn,"I’ve been severely depressed over the last couple of weeks and I’ve been trying to reopen the wounds of my childhood and one in particular is when I was in highschool in 10th grade. I don’t remember why I got in trouble but my mom punished me by locking me out of my bedroom, and not allowing me to shower nor change my clothes (including underwear). And I had to sleep on the couch without a blanket or pillow. I remember being a couple days into this punishment and I had sleeping pills that were prescribed to me by my psychiatrist. I remember getting up from the couch crying because I couldn’t understand why my mom would treat me like this. I went to the kitchen grabbed my sleeping pills and took all 27 pills. I wanted to die and I tried to kms. The next day I had school and I woke up super drowsy. I went to school and told my counselor what I did and immediately my mom was called and I had to be taken to the looney bin. 

Growing up I was always the one punished punished, even if it was something minor like not folding the laundry I would end up getting my phone taken away for months. If I didn’t say yes ma’am or no sir I would get a spankin. 

Was I just a horrible daughter. I don’t understand the punishments I would receive. I’m a mother now and I think about these things often and I would never treat my children the way she treated me. 

My brother also attempted suicide once I moved out. Literally my worst fear coming true. He put a belt around his neck and tightened is as much as he could, he blacked out and then heard voices screaming at him “wake up wake up!!! It’s not your time yet” he woke up. His hands were darker and it was hard for him to catch his breath. Our mom didn’t even notice he just tried to kill himself. My brother and I have both had close calls and these definitely weren’t our first attempts either. 

How can someone be so cruel to their kids that it makes them want to harm themselves. I’ll never understand. Our relationship with our mother is very rocky. At the moment I’m not speaking to her even tho she has tried to reach out. I just need space while I try to understand.

1j64m60,I believe that I am not cut out for life,"
I don't think I'm cut out for life. I don't feel like I'm fit in or in place. I am emotionally sensitive and empathetic. I don't feel like I belong. I can't find a job that pays a liveable wage. I have had a good amount of jobs for my age.  Don't have a driver license yet and I can't afford lessons right now but whats the point if I can't afford a car. Even if I work full time and make 600 a week I still wouldn't be able to afford one.

 I am in community college for accounting. I worked 30 hours a week at a pharmacy and made 400 a week still not enough. I can't afford anything and it sucks to know that this is how life is and I would have to work 3 jobs. I reduced my hours to focus on studying but now I can't afford hobbies or all of my needs and definitely not any wants. 

Right now I'm still studying but don't know how I will keep paying for college since my father is a tax evader for fafsa. I could do a payment plan but It will be all of my money. I binge eat. I don't have anyone to talk to. I have mental illnesses including depression and when I was on antidepressants I gained lots of weight and binge eating got worse so I stopped. I see a therapist and it doesn't help all they do is just suggest meds. 

My dad is dying and I never grieved my brother committing suicide. I'm lonely but a man could quickly make my life worse and more complicated. All the jobs I've been applying to virtually pay the same $12-18. I'm back to self harming. I feel like a failure and feel guilty for being alive. My parents are abusive but I don't want to have a victim complex. I still live with them and I am not able to afford to move out even with roommates. Maybe my expectations for earning is too high and my standards for life as well.

I went to beauty school to become a certified nail technician just to find that there's virtually no job openings out there for that near me at the moment. Or they are part time working 1-2 days a week. I'm considering selling press ons though but its a saturated market and I don't know who would buy from me. I have had 2 businesses ages 16-20 that flopped. Multiple hobbies that flopped and there is absolutely nothing that I am passionate about or enjoy. I don't enjoy entertainment either.

I'm not sure what to do with my life and how to feel better and I have been forcing myself for the past few weeks to forget every single thing and move forward but I genuinely do not see much to be happy about.

When I confided in my friend she said I'm privileged and my life is not that bad and they have it worse. I'm not doubting others have it worse at all. What prompted me to write this post is while searching for a new job because my current one I am very underpaid and staff is toxic and I am sick of abuse from the customers, I realized I still can barely find anything that would allow me to live that I got overwhelmed and cried and my mother said that I need to grow up and asked me how am I going to manage to survive which is true, and I don't think I will to be honest. She also said that me crying causes her stress and said that the stress I cause her and my dad is what turns them to drink. She says I make excuses which I think is true in some cases. I have been dissocoating for the past 6 years and every second every minute every week every month and every year passes by me in seconds. I will wake up one day and be 50 if i make it to then wondering where all the time has gone. 

I think the people in my life think I am weak which is true. I'm not even trying to seek pity or be self pity or a victim but I just don't see the point. I am not a victim it is all my fault and I believe any abuse that I have endured I must of have deserved it. I just get easily overwhelmed and I don't know why and I am immature. 

I don't know what to do with my life and I need someone to tell me.

1jnswsi,I haven't felt like myself in forever (please read),"I've never written on reddit before, this is my first time on here. I honestly don't know it anyone will care, but I wanted to get this out. (This will be long). I haven't been myself since I was 10. I've felt like a shell of myself ever since my preteens. I haven't been diagnosed with depression or anxiety or anything yet, but Im pretty sure I've got major depression. I have self-hatred issues. I've had suicidal ideation, and thoughts almost everyday. I think I might have face dysphoria too. I've been a complete and total disappointment and failure to my parents. And all I wanna do is make them proud of me. I know they love me more than anything, but they deserve better. I feel like I'm never doing enough. I wish I could be a better role model for my younger siblings. I wish I could be better for everyone around me. I can't get outta my goddamn head. Like I said I know ppl might not care much about this, but it's been ruining my life. I'm 18 now, and I just wanna get my life started, I want to get better for the ppl around me. I look in the mirror, I hate what I see. I hate myself from head to fucking toe. I know most of my issues are the fact I'm so self-destructive. And that I would feel much better if I had some self-love. But that's the thing. I don't have any for myself. It's been what everyone has been telling me to have more of. I don't know how. When I think about being 'kinder to myself' I just can't do it. I hate everything about myself. I wish was prettier, smarter, bolder, confident. I wish I could be the daughter my parents deserve. But it's like I've got this ball of hatred for myself. From the time I wake up in the morning to the time I got to sleep. I cant live like this anymore. I dont have it in me to harm myself, or end it all because I don't want to make them go thru that. I can't go back to who I was before this, I can't remember what I was like before all of this. I wanna fix myself, but it's so hard. I'm such a disaster. I don't know where to start.

1jnuaj7,a rant about how I hate myself because I can't tell my therapist,"I'm pretty sure I'm a piece of shit. I can't keep myself together and I'm just plain rude. Thursday, I was a dick to my math teacher when all she asked was if I needed to step outside because I had my head down. I can never say sorry to my boyfriend even when I know I'm in the wrong and it genuinely disgusts me to even think about apologizing. I have selfish thoughts about killing myself even when I know others care about me. Why should I complain about my issues when others have it so much worse? I would hurt so many people by doing it but for the past 4/5ish years not a single day has gone by where I haven't thought about it. I can't make up my mind on whether or not I'm angry at my dad for overdosing. It wasn't purposeful - I'm just pissed it happened in rehab and no one found his body until 2 days after. He was supposed to come to my 13th birthday.  I'm turning 15 this year and I know there's still so much for me to do but honestly, who gives a fuck? I'm lazy, stupid and again, a piece of shit. I have not a clue in the world what I want to do with my life. I live in a small hick town in Washington which I hate so much but I don't think I'll ever make it out. I'm smart but I do not apply myself. I know I'm still going through puberty but I have disgusting sexual thoughts almost every hour of the day and it's not normal stuff either. I can't stop self-harming (cutting, burning) or putting some not so great substances into my system. This post is just everything I don't want to tell my therapist, sorry.

1jsba0q,"My feelings are so confusing (mention of SH, suicide)","I genuinely do not know what I want. (Also trigger warning? I will be talking about people’s stereotypical views on depression and people with depression). But I like to think I’m not the crazy one.

I tried to sh today for the first time after my brain telling me to do it many times for months. There has been couple previous attempts that didn’t follow through because I am coward, but this time, I thought I was really gonna do it.

Sure I technically did it (or not; I feel like it’s really not SH based on the result). But nothing close to serious or anything. Nothing. I think I was too scared to actually put force into it. So that was basically pretending to sh. And I feel strange and stupid. 

Now the urge is gone after I did that (I am completely fine, basically no harm has been done!).

I feel so, so bad that I cannot stop thinking about suicide and sh and I can’t even bring myself to do a small damage. Maybe I’m not that depressed. So why do I feel miserable? Do I just want to do it because that is something depressed people do? Do I want attention by doing so? I don’t think I do. Then why can’t I actually do it? Am I not depressed enough? 

I keep thinking about suicide. And I want to. I think I would be happy if I were to die today, tomorrow, an hour later. But it’s not like I’m going to put effort into making it happen. I do my everyday work, come back, sleep and repeat. I know I’m scared to actually do it. There are so many ways one could theoretically do it. Why can’t I even attempt it? I just constantly think about it but I can’t do it. That has to mean that I secretly don’t want to die? But I hate myself and my life.

It’s so confusing. Honestly I feel like two persons; I can’t really remember what and how I felt when I am better and when I am depressed, I can’t relate to what I was feeling when I was good. Probably after some time passes, I probably would think I was crazy for trying to sh. I feel fine now. How? Why? Where did my urge go?

I just feel… stupid. I am ruining my own life. I wish I can actually do something or just stop thinking about it. Sorry, my writing is all over the place. I just needed to get this off my chest.",2025-04-05 22:19:59,3,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jsba0q/my_feelings_are_so_confusing_mention_of_sh_suicide/,"feelings confusing mention sh , suicide",0.185,0.698,0.117,-0.9941,high

Just whatever came to mind

I’m young so I know ppl will say I’m not a failure but I’ve wanted to disappear or Die since I was 5 and I know that might sound dramatic but it’s true if you choose to not believe that then whatever I’m done acting like it’s not true my birthday is in 2 and half or so months and I’m dreading it I tried to kill my self in January but I didn’t cuz my cousin wouldn’t stop texting me but now I wish I went through with it I can’t deal with it anymore 

I keep telling ppl I got better and I’m not hurting myself anymore but then one simple in convenience or mistake makes me feel like I ruined everything and like giving up and going to self harm again 

My uncle had cancer so I’ve been taking care of him and when we went to do something he told me to gove him his one card so I did but he then jokes and said he hopes I didn’t use all him money buying chicken sandwiches at the hospital and it made me feel bad and even worse cuz I spent a little more money that day not meaning to and all I wanted to do was cry and throw up or go and just cut myself 

I’m never home I spend five days a week taking care of my uncle and his dog cuz my mom is too busy with work or her husband my uncle isn’t a fan when my brother helps him since my brother is autistic and always has headphones on my step dad is either at work or drinking at him he always needs my moms attention and says she works to much or spend to much time with my brother or I but I’m never home I’m home on Saturday and Sunday then I’m at my uncles 

All my parents do is yell have sex and fight again I don’t want to be here I hate that I always tell my mom I want to go home but I never feel at home at the farm 

My moms whole family judges us cuz we aren’t religious or cuz my moms whole was a wild child and young adult so now they treat us differently and it makes me feel like some how I messed up and I failed 

At one point I got so depressed that I stopped taking care of the chickens and one died cuz the others started to eat it and now I feel guilty and like I failed at that 

I just don’t want to be here anymore I have no friends that live close I went back to homeschooling cuz the school I was at wasn’t working out for me 

Today I was trying to make cake pops and I messed up and there for my uncle who has cancer cuz it’s his birthday and I went to get my mon yet her and her stupid husband were to busy doing stuff even though I asked my step dad to tell her to come to the kitchen when she gets home but nope I hear the truck pull in and then I wait for 5 minutes and wait some more until I go to get her and she’s busy like always I just want to give up I don’t want to want her attention cuz I’m too old for it but damn she’s always too busy for it I’m always too busy taking care of shit when she is free and if she is free she’s always with her husband or on call with him when he’s at work and free 

Any and everything I do I second guess it or think I should go and hurt myself over it 

Like if I forget to go feed the dog immediately and start to do something else I feel like I need to go punish myself over it it can be the simplest things

I’ve never wanted to do self harm, but ive always thought of some form of physical harm happening to my body. I imagine im laying on my stomach, back to the air and theres just a knife lightly gliding over my back with it’s sharp blade. there’s no destination for this knife and no stop to it’s movements. sometimes it’ll go deeper, other times it’ll be light pokes. if the pain of what im going through feels too much to bear, it stabs through repeatedly until it feels fitting to the amount of mental anguish im in. 

I could never tell anyone this is what I imagine when im feeling low. I could never go to the people close to me and tell them the true depths of what’s happening to me. they all have their own problems, struggles, and hardships they’re going through. ive recently relearned it’s better to not involve people in what’s my burden to bear alone. id rather be there for them than let them be here for me. I only drag people down. I love the people that come to mind so much, more than they could ever know. but I just cant let them be apart of this. I wish I was truly alone, I know my existence is a burden. 

Im too much. I know people are happier without me around to bring them down. theres proof, proof that im my own repellant to the people I want to be around. I tried therapy, but now I dont have the time for it anymore. school is stressful beyond its means and work is tiring in all forms. this house feels suffocating yet I have no other place to call home. I feel trapped in a body I loathe. I tried applying for a free service for anxiety and depression meds recently, but my birth control makes me ineligible to get them. I cant give up my birth control. but I cant keep doing this. I feel trapped. I feel so numb yet I feel like im in so much pain. I feel like im at the brink where ive lost too much blood and my body feels cold but im still conscious. I’m a walking corpse.

I wish I could just cease to exist. I wish I could fall asleep and never wake back up. this is my first time finding this subreddit and, frankly, it’s terrifying. im seeing reflections of my own self. some with more balls than I could ever have, and some in the same boat as me. I feel seen but in the most gut wrenching way possible. I wish I wasn’t like this. I wish this and I wish that but I know im so underserving of it all.

1j5m4g9,I hate all of my psychiatrists,"Even after 7 years of visiting therapists, psychiatrists etc, I never found a single doctor that would actually help me.
There is one psychiatrist that I hate the most though. I never wanted another psychiatrist, but I had to since I was getting diagnosed and I had to talk to the local psychiatrist for more details. Now with my diagnosis, I go there for prescription for my medication, and of course that I have to talk to him first. At the very first introduction, he immediately made me uncomfortable. He wasn't watching his mouth, openly talking about my self harm addiction and asking me many questions about it. Which would be fine, only if he wouldn't start joking about it. 
„you never cut deep enough to get sent to the emergency hospital? So that means that you have more like cat scratches? Oh that's nothing don't worry."" But that wasn't the worst he said.
„are you left handed or right handed?"" Since the question was so out of context I was confused and answered his question. „right handed huh...well roll up your left sleeve."" And then he laughed. I was shocked and wanted to cry myself out but I was too scared to do so. That was the first time we met and had a conversation together.
 
A few days ago I had to get another dose for my meds and inform him that my anxiety disorder is making it difficult for me to do basic daily tasks. I needed some medication to ease it down since I had only meds for my other disorder. But when I told him about my issues with anxiety and that I'm experiencing panic attacks, he just answered by „you need to take deep breaths and that's it."" After that he interrogated me about my self harm and if it's continuing, after telling him that I'm clean for some time he said „well now you can go out into strip club and go on a dance pole!"" It made me feel so uncomfortable and disgusted.
 
Please, is this normal? How should I confront the doctor about him making me uncomfortable because I don't think he takes me seriously since I'm just a teenager.

1jln30j,Alternates to SH?,"  Hi, I'm looking for alternates to self harm. I have a long history with depression, PTSD, and quite possibly ADHD and some other learning disorders. I have been through YEARS of therapy, and I have turned my sh*tty a** life into something respectable from an outside perspective. I have a history of mild self harm, and have recently rediscovered the urge to hurt myself.
  I am married now (unlike before,) and I don't think I would be able to hide anything from my spouse, which is one of the strongest factors keeping me from starting again. I'm pretty sure she would be empathetic and just worried about me if I did, but I don't want to hurt or worry her. Pretty much all of the effective coping skills I worked on in therapy have become ineffective (I don't have time for some and have literally lost the ability for others due to health issues.) My current therapist is available about once per month, I've completed intensive outpatient programs, and inpatient care (and several different) medications were unhelpful. I feel like I'm going to explode, and I don't want anyone else to be caught in my mess.
  My wife is dealing with her own shit (but is in denial about it) and I feel like I can't turn to her because I don't want to be a burden or interfere with any progress she makes on herself. I have tried to get past that feeling but can't.
  I really just want to return to SH, but don't want to hurt people around me. I don't care if a coping mechanism  is ""healthy"" or not, I'm just trying to find something to help me survive and not lose my mind until I can find a better deal (I'm also randomly drug tested... so, that's out.)

1jdw7fq,A hard pill to swallow: life just moves on,"I’m in high school and recently a fellow student killed themselves with a gun. They showed up to school the day of, looking completely normal with nothing out of the ordinary going on with them. Fast forward to the next day and my school announces the passing of said student, allowing those affected by the loss to meet up and comfort each other. But after that, it has been business as usual, and I have barely heard anyone mention it. I asked my friend (who knew the kid better and spoke with him the day of the suicide) if there was any underlying reason. He told me that his best guess was that the kid had an intrusive thought and just decided to go through with it, also mentioning how it wasn’t worth it. 

I have pondered on the idea of death and suicide quite a bit, and this has to be one of the worst things that comes with suicide. After the initial shock of the event, only the ones closest to the victim will truly carry the memories, trauma, and pain of losing a loved one to suicide. Everyone else is seemingly forced to just move along with their lives, like one of the saddest things in life hasn’t just occurred; a child felt so hurt they decided they can’t go on with their life. This is one of the reasons why I am not planning on harming myself any time soon. As monumental or serious the problems you might face seem, it will likely be drowned out from the chaotic noise of our day to day society.

Maybe it’s an egoistic to want to have a lasting impact on the world if everything we know will eventually fade one day. But to me that begs the question of why we even live today regardless of our issues if it’s for nothing in the grand scheme of things. Whether we’re happy, sad, angry, or tired death will continue to be certain. Why isn’t something like hedonism the answer, to live for yourself or those closest to you as you might as well try to experience as much enjoyment as possible if you have to put up with reality. (Just letting loose some ideas, not saying I know or agree for certain)


While this thought terrifies me in the sense that our existence is a harsh / tough one, it also gives me a reason to keep going in the way that life is what you make of it, and suicide permanently ends any possibility of carving out a better future. I personally think that most people don’t hate life itself, they just hate their particular life that they live. I realize however that I don’t know the true extent of the struggles many people experience, so I’m not trying to downplay anything someone is going through. All I know is that life is hard, and I don’t blame anyone for not agreeing with my viewpoint as I too would probably think differently about things if I was in worse circumstances. I just tell myself to keep going because I don’t know what life can bring me yet, I’m still young enough to have hopes and dreams. That’s why I think this situation and youth suicide in general is so grim because we haven’t even seen the full extent of the world and we already want an escape. Or maybe I’m just crazy and overthinking things…..",2025-03-18 06:41:23,5,2,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jdw7fq/a_hard_pill_to_swallow_life_just_moves_on/,hard pill swallow life moves,0.226,0.671,0.103,-0.9987,unknown

Life has lost all meaning. I ride a combination of negative emotions. Dealing with harassment from a neighbor. Constantly looking over my shoulder now that I included the authorities. My job is a constant stressor yet I’m struggling to find a new one. Friends have completely disappeared from my life. I have no joy in the things that use to bring me peace of mind or even a distraction for a second because I feel like what’s the point if it’s just gonna go away. I don’t like this feeling and it’s affecting me in every facet of my life. I fantasize often about ending it all. I’ve tried countless times. I’ve tried therapists but nothing works. Multiple different meds. Weed helped for a moment but that even started to cause me physical harm. 

Maybe someone will read this. Not a cry for help. I just have nobody to vent to and everything is shit.

1jr26dn,I don't know what to do anymore,"To give detail, I am 16 years old and I am a cis gendered male. My entire life I have experienced nothing but hardships, and obviously that's nothing to cry over, everyone experiences difficulties. It's a part of life, but my struggles to me are major because of how sensitive I am to such things that aren't meant for an adolescent or child to experience so soon. 

I have ADHD, but this wasn't known until august of last year after I decided to get diagnosed. My entire life, I have had struggles functioning up to social standards, and with no surprise also academical standards. For the most part, I can remember growing up always feeling as if I was failing, or as if I was doing something wrong, as if something was wrong with me. I had behavior issues, difficulty focusing on my necessities and tasks. According to my teachers, I was a disobedient and misbehaving child who just needs to learn to sit still and pay attention more. But those such things weren't even of my control, my ADHD had been taking effect of almost everything in my life. Talking to my ADHD specialist about my childhood experience, she was saddened and surprisingly shocked to hear my fully detailed experience, and had mentioned on how she wondered how in the world no one detected the possibility of me having ADHD.

The effects of my ADHD took place up through all of elementary, middle school and even my freshman year. And I can remember every single detail, bad, good, painful, and even agonizing. Not to mention how my anxiety (which my psychiatrist diagnosed me) made everything so much worse for my mental health and performance. I had severe depression and still do unfortunately.

Another thing to add is how I was subject to so much trauma growing up. Memories of my mother abusing me because of my father's mistakes, and how they would argue and become violently constantly, or memories of my older siblings just getting into the worst altercations with my parents. There is so much I could tell but I want to spare the details to focus on how the main thing is, my trauma, life experience, mental illnesses have effected me so god damn severely in my life, and even after being medicated and trying to make myself better. Nothing feels like it's working.

I haven't cried in a month but today just sitting at my dining table watching the sunset, I cried remembering every single word that has been said to me, every single thought that kills me, and every single memory that made me miserable. 

I'm wondering when I'll finally live, not be a failure, not be so irritated towards others, or when I'll finally complete my homework when I need to. There's so much damn thought and desire that I have, I am just so tired, I am so tired of living and practically making my mental and physical healthy works with caffeine and nicotine, as well as isolating myself from everyone.

I have lost all joy in everything I do, I have lost every bit of interest or hope that I have of living well and normally. I want to commit self harm so badly, but I'm tired of being ridiculed and judged for it. I want to do so much, and I want so much to go away. I just want to know, when will everything get better??? 

When in the fuck will I finally be a normal human being and not be the way I am, I want to be someone new and I've been trying so hard, but yet even what I try hard is never enough, I want things to be fine, I want everything I could ever hope for from myself to actually happen.

New to the community and diagnosed recently with depression and anxiety. For years I’ve been down about things and in my head. Obvious signs of depression and anxiety but took me years to see someone about it. 


I’m 22m, in November I started a new job. It was going well, just minor stress being at a prominent position. Nothing I couldn’t manage. Then in December, I got rnhabdomylosis which ended me up in the hospital. I went in and out a few times since but looking back I think it was anxiety attacks. 

Now my big issue, I’ve had such extreme fatigue for months. I haven’t been able to function at night time and my body shuts down. Thought the day I feel such exhaustion and my body gets hot. By eyes burn and my body is weak. I can’t go out anymore because once it’s night time I just fall asleep physically. Mentally I’m awake but my arms get weak and my legs turn jelly. Last night my dog woke me up and I went to take him out and I was having issues walking. 

I was diagnosed with gad and depression recently and started steralinine 50mg once daily, started last Friday. 

Anyone have similar situations/ feelings that can help here? Ruled out major issues and any deficiencies already. ",2025-03-12 03:44:51,2,3,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1j96mhr/i_need_help_badly_please/,need help badly please,0.143,0.821,0.036,-0.9771,unknown

1jooe12,"I don't know what to do, I'm really tired","I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this, I don't want to keep doing this. I don't want to live, I'm tired. 

I can't count the number of times I've woken up and my first thoughts are of ending things. I want peace, I want freedom, I want to stop feeling shitty all the time, I want to experience life as a better, more valuable man. I struggle to believe that's possible for me, I feel too far gone, too wrong, like life wasn't meant for me. 

I don't know why I never went to college, maybe I was too lazy, or too far gone with mental health. I was still able to get an okay job, with benefits and an average wage. Despite that, my upward mobility is likely non-existent, I'm going to be this forever, I'm never going to be impressive the way I would need to be to live the life I envision. I work with taxes, and regular see people paying more with a single cheque than I've ever accumulated over the course of my entire life, it's crushing. I failed financially. 

Not that my job is going to do me much good if the world implodes. Things just seem to get worse, life is unaffordable, populations are getting dumber and more violent and more hateful, social cohesion is dissolving, new wars are starting, the environment is screwed, scientists have noticed an asteroid. I failed to be lucky, to be born in a better time and place. 

I struggle socially. I have a few good friends, and I see them semi-regularly, but I'll lose them eventually and I doubt my ability to make new ones; I certainly don't have the energy or mental bandwidth. I've never been in a relationship, and as uncomfortable as it is to admit, sex is a big problem. I spent my childhood religious, learning to be deeply uncomfortable with the idea of intimacy done ""incorrectly"", and now that I've deconstructed I realize that it was never going to work for me anyway. I'm not attractive, not tall, not fit, not funny, not charismatic, not rich, not anything -

- what I am is a hypocrite, being attracted to and desperately wanting experiences with women who I find exceptionally attractive while I look the way I do, without the ability to offer any kind of attractiveness in return. Please don't misunderstand, I'm not a misogynist, I don't think I'm entitled to it. I dislike and vehemently disagree with incels; they spread and perpetuate wrong and harmful rhetoric. Unfortunately the term applies to me, definitionally. If I end up leaving life behind, I hope people don't remember me as being lumped in with them. I failed to be the person I wanted to be. 

I don't know why I'm posting this, I don't know what I want out of it. I guess if nothing else, I wanted to vent. I don't believe there's anything that can help me, not in a meaningful way, to hope for that would be hoping for the impossible. ""The universe is, and we are"". It's just not a universe made for me, and I want to leave it.

I am in a constant state of contentness (not sure if that’s a word). I was at one point extremely depressed, and one day about 2 years ago, I just felt better about everything. I stopped self-harming, I was taking care of myself, and I became a social butterfly. I am still all of those things. However, I do not care about the people in my life. I feel selfish, I only care about losing them. Me and my boyfriend of 8 months got into an extreme argument because he couldn’t handle an addiction I have and am actively trying to get rid of. He ended up having a panic attack and I couldn’t help him at all. He was balling his eyes out in my arms and I felt nothing. We argued less than an hour ago and almost broke up because truth be told I have done some horrible things that he doesn’t deserve. I promised him I would figure out why it is so hard for me to care and I was wondering if anyone had any idea what this could be/how I could fix it. 

Also, I am not able to access a therapist right now. I had a court ordered one but it didn’t get renewed because the “issue” was resolved.

1jjc2fu,Should I institutionalize myself?,"First Reddit post, sorry for any formating issues. 

  
I, 25 F, have been dealing with depression for as long as I can remember. I was officially diagnosed at 15 and have been in therapy and on medication since. I've gotten to the point with my depression where treatment isn't working and I don't know what to do. 

  
To provide a little bit of context: I have been prescribed almost every anti-depressant you can think of, SSRI, SNRI, Mood Stabilizer, and Anti-Psychotic. I'm currently on 5 medications, a mixture of SSRIs, Mood Stabilizer,s and Anti-psychotics. I have officially been diagnosed with C-PTSD, Anxiety, Depression, Panic Disorder, BPD, ASD, and ADHD (I know, it's a lot). I have tried various types of therapy (CBT, DBT, psychotherapy, Individual Therapy). I see my therapist weekly and psychiatrist monthly. 

  
I am officially diagnosed with Severe Treatment Resistant Depression. Since I can remember, I have been wanting to die. I have never found joy in life and don't see much of a point in continuing it. I stay around because I know my friends and family would miss me but that doesn't seem like enough of a reason anymore. I'm tired of everything. I've tried to take my life 7 times at this point but it seems like some force out there is wanting me to stick around. To be honest, I'm scared of dying but that seems to be where all roads are leading. 

  
I recently started TMS for my depression and haven't noticed any differences. I'm still having extreme suicidal and self harm thoughts. I know that TMS takes a while to take effect but I'm at my whit's end. I don't think I am ready to leave yet but my brain is telling me otherwise. 

  
My question is, should I institutionalize myself? Would that help at all? I've been baker acted once before and that wasn't a pleasant experience so I'm honestly scared. But that seems to be my last option. Nothing else has worked. I'm tired of feeling like this and just want to be able to enjoy life.  I want to be able to smile with my friends and find happiness in the little things. 

  
My father was a bipolar addict and spent most of my life in and out of residential hospitals. It seemed to help him whenever he went. I wonder if they would be able to help me. Does anyone have experience with this? Any advice is appreciated.

1jcqr30,i'm so fucking sick,"i'm 16 and i've been depressed as long as i can remember. started smoking at 14, dealing with self-harm since i was 12, first attempt at 13. life lately has been getting more and more frustrating and i don't know what to do anymore. everything is simply monotone and depressing at this point. i'm always dead exhausted, i can't do anything and nothing helps me with my mind. i can't get distracted, i don't want to reach out for help and i couldn't even if i did cuz my parents are assholes (they found out i self-harm and love humiliating me and making fun of me for that), so threapy is out of question. my body and head aches all the time and i get sick for no reason at all. i'm trans (most people don't know about it) and deal with dysphoria daily, which simply kills any sense of self-esteem i've ever had. the only friend i have doesn't give a shit about how i feel and i have terrible trust issues, which keeps me from meeting new people.

i don't wanna live, but i just don't have the guts to try ending it anymore. i've tried more times than i can tell, and only ended up hurt and more hopeless. the possibility of having to endure this shit until i grow old or something makes me terribly anxious and desperate, still i can't act on it. i'm a fucking coward.

don't tell me ""you're just young, soon it will get better"", i'm fucked up since i was a damn child and i'm not willing to wait and see. they say i'm living the best years of my life, i can't even imagine what will it be like in the future.

1jo607w,I have started cutting myself again... I want to talk about it somewhere just to vent.,"I don't know why but I feel better after cutting myself. I hesitate when I'm about to do it, but once it's done, I feel a lot of relief... I don't know why. 

I have been battling this stuff for 5 years now, I guess? It's hard to pinpoint when it started, but it became a lot when my parents divorced. I was 14 then. I lived with my mom, and pretty much lived 4 years on edge. Each day, I was just a bit afraid of when my mom would shout at me. Whenever she came from court, she would be very pissed off, and would shout and yell horrible stuff at me...that I was just like my dad, that no mother should be cursed with a son like me, and a lot more. She probably said that stuff to my little brother too who was around 9, but I think his brain forced him to forget about it, because he doesn't seem affected by it now. Good for him.

Soon, my depression reached a point where I started having thoughts about ending myself, making up various scenarios in my mind and how others may react. I started cutting myself, because I didn't have the courage to end it... Soon, my friends found out and stopped me, making me promise not to do this ever again, which I didn't for a while.

Studies also put a lot of pressure on me as I was prepping for an entrance exam. One day, my mom saw my scars and asked me about it, though she knew what it was. That's when she knew about my depression and stuff. Later on, when she got angry, she started saying stuff like I should have ended myself, and that I'm here just to pester and trouble her. God knows how I survived that stuff, but I am pretty scarred now.

Soon, my mom had to get admitted to a hospital, that's when my dad came in and basically rescued me and my little brother. Now, I still struggle with mental health in college. I have nothing to show for, and I have achieved nothing good in college or in anything recently. I went from being called a gifted kid to now this. Something about early success.

Frequent arguments with my mom don't help either. Simple cycle: My mom is in a bad mood and says horrible stuff about dad or me, I try to calm her down, I finally snap and call her out on her actions, she disowns me, then she forgets about it in a few days and begs for me to forgive her  
I know she loves me, because my dad said that my mom suffers from schizophrenia, even though she denies it. At first, I refused to believe it but now, I don't doubt my dad. I have trust issues now, especially with my mom. My life feels like a rollercoaster that just goes down and down and down.

I'm struggling with suicidal thoughts and self-harm now, and it's just a matter of when I gain the strength to end myself. Everyone tells me that things will get okay soon, that something good will surely happen soon, but I've been hearing that for months now. I can only hold out for so long. I am tired of giving 100% of my efforts, only for them to go to waste EVERY FUCKING TIME.  
At this point, I just don't want to feel like a complete failure in life, even though I can't help but feel like that. I want to know that I made a positive difference, that I actually did succeed in something. I am trying to stay strong, but I don't know till how long can I keep this up. I don't want to feel this sadness, pain and weight on my chest anymore, no matter what. I feel like I may take things in my own hands and just end it all if I don't start getting any positive results in literally anything, because I'm tired of trying over and over again with nothing to show for.",2025-03-31 18:33:00,2,0,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jo607w/i_have_started_cutting_myself_again_i_want_to/,started cutting ... want talk somewhere vent .,0.15,0.7,0.151,0.1598,high
1jcgxs9,i feel so alone,"my boyfriend isn’t there for me

i don’t know how to keep doing this. 

my bf (25m) & i (23f) have been together on & off for 2 years. we both REALLY struggle with mental health problems & are both medicated. 

he’s currently going through a lot because he’s in the process of taking over his family business. he’s under a lot of stress & really struggles with confidence due to his dads verbal abuse 24/7. 

i moved to our city 3 years ago & am away from all family/friends. i am fully financially independent & live in a studio apartment with my cat. 

last may we broke up due to him being unable to show up for me when i was struggling. we were broken up the whole summer then got back together in august. since this ive REALLY struggled to communicate & confide with him. 

when we got back together i lost my grandma & i’ve been struggling since. 

i’m currently mentally at my lowest. today he tried to talk to me about it all, because ive shut off the entire world except work & my home. i’ve been smoking everyday & have just lost all motivation. 

tonight i think i hit rock bottom. 

after this conversation about how my mental health is effecting him, we were supposed to go to a friends sleepover birthday party & when it came time to leave i started crying. 

i told him to go without me & he did. the moment he left i had a panic attack. i didn’t reach out to him, i eventually calmed myself down & laid in bed. 

an hour later he called me, he just was double checking that i didn’t want to come & even though i did, i told him i didn’t & began to cry again. i had another panic attack & ended up throwing & breaking my phone. 

i texted him & told him i broke my phone & apologized for hanging up so abruptly. i told him to not worry about me & go have fun. 

i texted him asking if he could spend the night at 10pm & he didn’t respond until 12. when he did respond, he didn’t acknowledge, what i said & just apologized & said he’s drunk.  i just apologized for him for tonight & said goodnight. 

tonight was the first time ive ever self harmed. 

i feel so stupid & dramatic & embarrassed. i cut up my fking leg, just about broke my hand & slammed my head until i went dizzy. i feel like im insane. 

all i wanted during that was someone to come help me. i texted him, but i guess i can’t communicate it in a clear enough way. 

now i dont even know if i want to see him. i feel so abandoned & alone. i dont know what to do. as much as i want him to be here for me, i just feel so hurt.

1jnt65m,I Need Help,"I need help.  Six months ago, my partner of three years broke up with me.  He kicked me out of his house that he promised me was my own home as well.  He was abusive in every way there is: emotionally, mentally, verbally, and physically.  For whatever reason, I loved him and cannot seem to get over this break up.  
I am unemployed due to an injury, but do not qualify for unemployment benefits, or social security benefits.  Even if I did, it would not be enough to live off of.  I have been diagnosed with complex PTSD, persistent depressive disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety, ADHD.  I've been able to pull myself up out of the hole of depression multiple times in the past, but this time is very different.  
I cannot seem to find hope, motivation, ambition, or the desire for anything.  I don't care to see anyone, hear anyone, do anything, hang out with anyone anywhere, get a job, find a place to live, and if I didn't have to get out of bed, I wouldn't.  I am forty years old and had to move back in with my parents when my ex kicked me out of his house.  I avoid my parents at all cost because I'll probably just disappoint them, and they'll absolutely get onto me about what I ""should"" do.  
Granted, I should probably listen to them and just do whatever they say, as it's better for me than whatever the hell I do on my own now.  


Nothing in the town where I live is affordable.  I mean nothing.  I have no college degree, no special skills that are worth mentioning, and to sum it up pretty accurately, I'm a loser, just as my ex told me I am.  
I've got nothing.  If I keep going on like this, I'm just going to die.  Heartbreak, depression, carelessness, I don't know what from, but I can feel it.  I'm in no way saying that I am going to harm myself intentionally at all.  I just feel sick.  Not as in virus sick, but like, just sick.  Almost like how I hear what it's like to experience failure to thrive.

1jo3o58,Melancholy,"Depression is so exhausting. It can be so daunting to have to exist. I talked about my view point of ‘ethical euthanasia’ for adults and it’s never an easy conversation….. no one ever understands how much someone just wants to rest. I’m tired. I choose to feel so I don’t numb. I don’t self harm besides skipping too many meals, I want to eat …. sometimes. That’s exhausting too. I wish I could just slip away, into a coma like state, where I can dream, where I’m not bound to other people. 

Living for yourself is easier said than done when you don’t have the energy to keep your mindset in check. I don’t accept medicine, I’ll feel it all, I’ll cry alone, I’ll keep my emotions so I don’t go numb again. I can’t go numb again. I feel like medicine to help my brain isn’t something my body wants & maybe I feel shame. Maybe I’m just too embarrassed, but something has to change. I don’t want to feel guilty for my emotions, I’m not afraid to say it out loud because “what’s the point”. Who will agree? Who will understand my perspective. I can laugh at the most miserable moments in life because ‘what the fuck was that’ , so smiling … it’s just that.

I just got into college, just got an internship, and it's still not enough for me to grow any sort of confidence and make some friends or find some people who like me. I'm a failure as a human being.

I am so tired of trying. Too many awkward moments have left my mouth with a sour taste. I can't even enjoy other people's company anymore, because my self-aware brain will always screw up things in ways I can't even begin to understand why. I just feel like I'm MEANT to be lonely, I'm destined for this. I have no social skills, too self-aware about my looks, about the way I talk, everything is a reason for low self-confidence. I'm so tired of trying and yet, so desperate to be liked by someone, to have someone that truly appreciates me for who I am. Words can't describe the pain I have caused myself and others as well. I f\*\*\*ing hate myself.

I think I'll just take some sleeping pills and mix them with my dog's seizure medication (I'll obviously leave some for him so my sister is able to take care of him). That oughta do the trick. I'll sleep real good and it'll be as if I never even existed. No pain, no suffering, no struggling. Just a peaceful lights out. I hope I can be remembered for something good, because I've never intended to harm anyone.

1j8sia2,Anyone else experiencing ergophobia? (fear of work),"I just found out that my fear of work is called ergophobia.
I’ve been dealing with anxiety my whole life: scared to go to school, to uni, now I’m struggling with keeping up with my job. 
I’m not sure if something in my childhood caused this, but just thinking of how people might perceive me at work, if I do something wrong, if I ask stupid questions - makes me panic to the point I feel paralysed. 
The funny part is that I consider myself pretty smart and capable, but anxiety makes me fail at almost everything I do, I tend to avoid things that seem difficult and might cause any inconvenience. 
I work as a project manager, it’s been almost 3 years now. 
As an introverted person I find this position already hard enough and not very suitable. But when I first got the offer it was the best day of my life. I’m shocked that I’ve somehow managed to keep this job and pretend I’m good at this. 
Every email distresses me so much, I’m scared to start the day, because I have no idea what to expect and how to act, I overthink and end up replying something stupid. Usually, before replying to emails I compose a draft and send it to myself several times, trying to build different scenarios, now I’ve started to do the same with simple work chat messages (even if my reply is just one word). I know this is crazy and I have no idea how to fix my brain. 
It’s exhausting and started to affect my mental health severely. 
I’m thinking of leaving this place, but that would be another proof of my avoidant behaviour which I find embarrassing. That would mean I’m weak and gave up once again instead of pushing through. 
I’m looking for job offers now but pretty sure no matter the job I’ll feel the same everywhere. It wouldn’t be a brand new start and I won’t act differently. 
I’m lost and it makes me feel suicidal. 
I have history of suicidal thoughts and attempts, I was diagnosed with depression, bulimia and anxiety disorder, but you can’t really get any good help in my country. I’m trying to handle things myself and it’s not going good obviously. I don’t want to harm myself, I think my life is alright but I can’t change the way my thoughts bring me to dark places. If anyone is going through the same thing I’d love to hear your insights/advices.
Sorry if it’s all over the place and if my English is rusty.

1jmo5hf,World gets so dark when anxious,"My anxiety was under good control the last years, unfortunately I had a huge setback a week ago and even ended up in a emergency service. 
This did more harm then good, only got prescribed a whole lot of medication which I am afraid to take. 

Let me describe the setback in detail. I woke up in the middle of the night with a feeling of endless senselessness and unhappiness immediate followed by anxiety and panic. 
Ever since I'm fully back on the anxiety train. Ruminating, spinning thoughts, anxious. But I can't remember having such a terrible feeling of hopelessness when the spiral starts (maybe I had it earlier, but just buried it or forgot it). It feels like if nothing will have a chance to be good again, that I will forever be stuck in this mind hell and the only way possible is down.
So as soon as I enter the anxiety and rumination spiral I feel like I am in the mid of a major depression. No positivity left. This feeling is so painful that any skills I gathered in the past  are not enough to break out of it. It's the worst state of mind I have ever been in.

1jsk9dq,I had a really good day today…and then at RANDOM began to feel that de-personalization feeling come on. The beginning of a panic attack…,"This has happened only one other time for me. The first time was many years ago, when I was very hungover and just made it back home after a grueling two hour drive. I was sitting at home on my couch recovering, watching TV when all of a sudden I felt that feeling of impending doom creeping up, feeling like everything around me was fake. It was terrifying. I think it was because I made my body such an uncomfortable place to be that I was trying to get away…if that makes any sense at all. 

But today was different…the setting was similar as I was sitting on the couch watching TV again, relaxing after a full day. But the thing is I had been eating healthy, drinking my water, no alcohol whatsoever, and had an all around good day today with family and my dog…

When all of a sudden as I’m sitting there on the couch my hands start tingling a bit, I feel a little light headed, so I get up to go to the bathroom to look in the mirror and my pupils looked really small. Not sure if this was real or if my mind was playing tricks on me. I had to talk myself down and tell myself I’m perfectly healthy, nothing happened out of the ordinary, I’m home and everything is normal…these were the things I was telling myself. That de-personalization feeling comes on so quick, and I feel like only I can understand it. I didn’t even share this with my partner in that moment, because it was only for a few minutes. After I had gotten some food in me I felt better. 

I had a bit of a traumatic experience earlier this week when I had to take my dog to the emergency vet because we thought he may have ingested a harmful medication. Could it be that the panic has been delayed somehow? Like the aftershock of that experience…

Idk guys. I feel like I’m on an island with this de-personalization thing. I don’t even want to explain it to family or friends because it sounds crazy. 

Can anyone out there relate? Thank you.

1jke9u9,Vitamin D,"Guys,
I never get involved in forums or anything and usually just suffer myself and find my own options. With that being said, if someone like me had information that could have helped me not endure all I have this year, I would have begged them for the info.

This post isn’t a diagnosis, not a certainty or meant to be an alternative to medication and professional help but it is meant to ease some anxiety. If even one person finds this helped them, that’s one less person who went through what was my personal hell.

My entire life I never had energy, had a hard time staying on task and keep interested in stuff. After high school I got severe depression and anxiety which may have been contributed to an accutane reaction but that’s not the point. I’m photosensitive and burn easily as well.
Always being tired, off task, sad, disconnected and fidgety/ restless was always pawned off as ADD and GAD and no one ever thought differently.

After 44 years, a doctor ordered a vitamin D blood test and actually followed through. One did it in the past but didn’t ever communicate the results before she got fired so whomp.
I have had vitamin D deficiency for at the very least 6 years and most likely the majority of my life. 
Why does this matter?

The normalized scale of vitamin D is 31/32-100ng/ml. It’s better to be higher 60ng/ml. I was at less than 20.

I was in the process of playing with my dose of Effexor with my doctors help because of heightened anxiety and panic attacks (btw, yes higher doses of Effexor can cause extreme restlessness and sleep disturbances) when the test came in and I saw the results in my portal and asked my doctor what to do. Long story short, he started me on 50,000IU of D2 a week which I took three days ago and I have already noticed a significant difference that even my family is bringing to my attention unsolicited.

I never thought of vitamin d being a catalyst to my heightened symptoms and issues even though the signs were painfully obvious. I was like the doctors, “if it’s my emotions and my brain, then it must be my brain.”
Nope, my life long, yet unknown, battle with vitamin d resistance was pulling the strings.
It’s very unlikely that vitamin depletion can cause a diagnosis of anxiety or depression but trust me when I say it DEFINITELY plays a huge and commanding part of it.

I am going to end up being on a higher than average dose of vitamin D for the rest of my life and may face calcium issues later in life but physical pains heals and can be treated but mental pain is torture.

People, there’s no harm in requesting a vitamin d 25 hydroxy test from your doctor and even some hospitals have a selftest lab service where you pay out of pocket (roughly $50) and don’t need an order. If you don’t get a lot of sun exposure and don’t take a multivitamin or any supplements, it’s worth the shot.
Your doctor will get the results one way or another regardless of what way you test and if your levels are under 31, ask him/her for high supplemental therapy. If it’s over 31 but not around 60+, ask about taking a supplement of at least 1000IU-1600IU a day.

Worst case scenario, the vitamins aren’t an issue and you just keep doing what you can to find your coping mechanisms but best case scenario, it damn near solves everything. 
I never knew how much positivity I had deep inside me and how much joy and energy someone could experience and what I’m feeling now is a foreign experience for me but not in a bad way.
My blood circulation even improved and my feet are room temperature for the first time in my life.

I would have given anything for this information a month ago and I pray someone can benefit from this so at least one less person has to suffer.

1jeks2b,Buspirone,"So I have a hx of mdd, and gad. I have cycled through antidepressants off and on since I was 16 and am currently on lexapro 20 mg in my 30s. It has worked the best.  I had been getting the runaround by my primary care provider,  I ended up in the ER on NYE with a referral to psychiatry. Finally got into psychiatry in January 2025, had the intake, was told to stay on Lexapro and see if it treats both the mdd and the gad. It helped with the mdd but not as much with the gad. I saw my psychiatrist again in February and he gave me buspirone 5mg once in the morning and 5mg at night.  He said it would take time to build up in my system and it may make me more anxious but according to him that means it's working well.  I've been on 5mg twice a day since the end of February.  I've had weird dreams/nightmares and I feel more anxious.  I let him know that and he told me to stay on it until the end of March when I see him again and he would probably increase the dosage to 10 mg. He said the maximum dose for an adult is 30mg.

I've looked online, read reviews, and it seems like the drug is hit and miss,  it may work for some people and for some people it  doesn't.  Am I  too forward in thinking that if I'm not tolerating it at the lowest dose, raising the dosage is not going to help me.

I have a hx of self harm,  mdd, had major medical problems( I'm still dealing with a major medical problem), and autoimmune disorders. I've had trouble sleeping and I just feel weird on this medication.  

Any advice or recommendations? I want to try something else but my provider is insistent that this medication is a  fix it for the anxiety, combined with the lexapro and the therapy I am doing on my own with a therapist in private practice.

1jeda44,Doc forcing me to taper off Klonopin. Terrified,"I've been on the same dose (1.5mg) for 10 years and it has helped take my anxiety from a 9 to about a 5 or 6. I still have issues with GAD but can at least leave my home, be social, date, etc, and I experience fewer panic attacks as well. 

Doc is very anti-benzo and thinks it's doing more harm than good for me to be reliant on it. She wants to replace it with remeron. I don't want to be too resistant to her bc I don't want to be labeled an addict and treated like one, but I know my anxiety and how difficult it is to keep at bay and prevent it from starting to destroy my life once it digs its claws in. It's started really creeping back with a recent drop to 1.25, and now she's knocking me down to 1 mg. It's happening very quickly and despite my protestations she just has a plan and she's stubbornly sticking to it.

I also tried therapy to no avail. And then i started alcohol. It helped my anxiety a bit so i kept drinking from time to time.

1jforqa,I'm going through immense suffering and people are laughing at me.,"I’m exhausted. Every day, I wake up and go to the hospital. I’ve seen doctors from almost every department, and yet, every single one tells me it’s just anxiety. I panic over the smallest things—like a tiny scratch—convinced it will turn into something serious. No matter how irrational it seems, I can’t stop myself from rushing to the hospital. Today, the staff even laughed at me because I’m there so often. I felt like a clown.

Meanwhile, I see people my age enjoying life—riding bikes with their partners, hanging out with friends—while I waste my time and my parents’ money on hospital visits. My biggest fear right now? That my penis is permanently damaged due to extreme masturbation—10 to 20 times a day for the past 10 years. I’ve had erectile dysfunction since 2022, and I suspect I have Peyronie’s disease, even though multiple urologists ruled it out. They say my penis looks normal, but how can they be sure without proper tests like a Penile Doppler Test? I’ve also been experiencing extreme numbness and discoloration in one part of my penis, yet doctors keep saying it’s okay. Are they being dismissive just because they assume my anxiety is making me imagine things? Do they have some kind of preconceived notion or prejudice against me—that I’m just an anxious, paranoid person and not worth taking seriously?

But where did this anxiety even start? Is it genetic? My father was always an anxious person—stressing over things others wouldn’t. He used to hit me almost every day until the 9th or 10th grade. I couldn’t fight back. As I grew older, I became toxic too. I started taking out my anger on my mother. The cycle of abuse continued until one day, I cut off contact with my father. He stopped abusing me, but I couldn’t stop myself from physically harming my mother. It became a part of our daily lives, and I know that’s not normal.

The worst part? Outside my home, I’m a completely different person. I don’t bully anyone. I don’t get into fights. But the moment I step inside, I become someone else. I hate it.

Sometimes, I feel like ending my life. But I don’t want to die. I still believe I can turn things around. I just don’t know how. I want to be loved. I want to be a good person. I want to be happy.

The happiest time in my life? When I was dating my ex. That was the first time I truly fell in love. I’ve been in relationships before, but this was different. I felt so joyful, so alive. And strangely, that was the period when I masturbated the least. My lust disappeared. I respected her so much that I couldn’t even think of her sexually, especially in the beginning. It felt like divine love—love without lust. I was obsessed with her, ready to do anything for her. But in the end, she ruined me. She cheated on me too.

So, what is it? Can love heal me? Or is it something I have to fix on my own? Am I like this because I’ve spent years stuck inside my room with no social life? I didn’t go to a regular college. After high school, I just stayed at home. Could that be the reason my mental health is so bad? Would having more sexual experiences help?

I don’t know what to do. I believe in God. I pray all the time, asking for relief, for happiness, for peace. But I’m still suffering. I just want to sit by the beach, watch the sunset, feel the breeze, and relax. But my mind won’t let me.

Even as I write this, my anxiety is telling me something terrible is about to happen. That I’ll get diagnosed with some awful disease. That my worst fears will come true. And if that happens, what will I do? Cry? Give up? Live in misery forever?

I don’t know. But I do know I need to change. I need to save myself. I just don’t know where to start.

1jemdm5,Tracking Anxiety (Trying to get a diagnosis),"I have suffered from anxiety about basically everything for almost as long as I can remember. I'm in high school at the moment, for context of how long that is. I plan to be seeking a diagnosis in the near future, but I want to make sure I'm prepared. I have my journals since I was six that I could use as evidence of a problem but I feel like I should have better documentation of my exact thoughts. The thing is… I'm always anxious. I constantly listen to music, podcasts, or videos in an attempt to block out the anxiety, so there are so many thoughts I can't keep track of all the things I'm thinking.

I have tried before to make a chart of when, where, and what I think anxiously, but it's literally everything. For example, I think about Loki constantly (he's my current hyperfixation) and I LOVE it but I also feel like it's a sign of there being a problem. Other times I think about my family or myself being harmed, arrested, etc. You get the picture. There's too much worry all the time for this to work.

I don't remember everything that I have anxiety about because it occurs randomly and is present 24/7 and I have some memory issues, so I can't even make a list at the end of the day about what I was thinking.

So, I have two questions.
1. What ways have you kept track of your thoughts? What suggestions do you have for how I could keep track of thoughts?
2. This question is mainly for people who have gone through the diagnostic process for generalized anxiety disorder. What does the diagnostician need for this? Do they need a detailed record of my anxious thoughts and proof of how long I've had them?

1jpdpgt,I Feel Like I Am Slowly Dying,"19F. PCL-5 65 CPTSD, ADHD, Depression, and of course the worst one, Anxiety. (Possible Self Harm Trigger) 

I don't get a moments rest. I wake up at 4AM from nightmares despite taking Prazosin every day twice a day. I fall back asleep and wake up a few hours later exhausted, lethargic, scared. 
I am tired constantly, yet shaking from adrenaline. I do not eat; I am riddled with nausea and my gag reflexes is always on. My skin burns; I break out in hives and acne from stress. I do not leave the house; I have no IRL friends. And if I do leave the house, it's to go to the store, park, or therapy with my mom (who is the source of my PTSD, but she's the only thing that is predictable.) I completed high school online; my grades were slipping due to me being too afraid to show up or participate in class. I had to take my mother's gabapentin to even make it through half of the day. I do not work. The first and last official job I had was when I was 17. I only got it because all of my friends had jobs. ""You're the only one of us that doesn't work"" they said. So, I got a job- retail. I only lasted 5 shifts. I was having panic attacks before each shift, I couldn't remember anything, I felt incompetent and stupid. I relapsed in SH because of this. I had to quit and was burnt out for 6 months. This made me feel even worse. 

I can't function- I *don't* function. 

I jump at even the slightest of loud noises. I sometimes even cry. I am constantly masking. I am tired. 

I've never known anyone to have anxiety this bad. I've failed on SSRI's. Mirtazapine makes me even more tired than I already am. Ritalin gives me panic attacks. 

I am in DBT, and group CBT for anxiety. I've been in therapy since I was 11 years old because I was in foster care. 

I am never allowed to be authentic. My face, my voice, my walk, my hair, my clothes, my gestures, they are all either too much or not enough. 
I am so insecure in myself. I have to look perfect just so people are nice to me- even a little bit. If everything isn't just right, I won't leave the house. And if I have to leave the house, I will be angry and cry. Because people can sense something is just off. They know something is wrong with me. 
I feel like everyone got an instruction manual to life and I was left out. They can walk, breathe, laugh, speak, stand, sit, eat, without even thinking. And then there is me. Just stumbling around like some scared dog. 

Please do not say it gets better. I've been like this for 19 years, it has only gotten worse. I care about the now. I'm not in the future. I am in the present. And my present is hell. 

My body is screaming, my brain is screaming. I am too scared to be perceived. I fawn, I freeze, I'm a total pushover. Or I'm angry, violent, and outspoken. 

Does anyone relate to this extreme level 10 anxiety? I see people on here are anxious, but they still function just fine. I rarely see people with disabling anxiety.

1jin326,Iam Sorry,"I was too afraid to end it all, maybe I was in an advanced situation or stopped. Let's put an end to this drama, I will be responsible for all the consequences I have done. Before I want to apologize to everyone about what is currently happening, I want to apologize sincerely to all those who were harmed. 
I really want to feel better, I have been depressed for months, feeling excessive anxiety, disappointed with myself, blaming everything that has happened to myself. I like to ask myself, Am I mentally ill? What's wrong with me? I don't know how to describe it. I don't think there's a word anymore about everything going to be okay, I already feel like it's all just bullshit for me. Sometimes I still do some things that actually still hurt me, whether I do it consciously or not. After that the burden piled on my shoulders, I didn't know how to tell a story, How to explain what I was going through. I pull away from people slowly so that I don't bother the people around me. But on the one hand I feel happy, people around me still think I'm fine, at least I don't make those who think like that feel that I am a burden. I feel jealous of people who have a purpose in life, have a sense of the direction of life want to be like what or how to be. The thought of death scares me and the thought of failure and having to endure the consequences might be even scarier, but I also don't see myself moving forward and having goals, relationships, or a future the way other people do. Every night I just mumble about how stupid I am, about what the hell I've done. Regret comes at the end. Everyone is probably wondering what the hell do I expect after this? can I still be on the right path? At the end of this moment I can answer that I don't expect anything after this, I am very afraid of messing up and being more trapped in my life that I don't know what it will be like. I can't imagine what my life will be like in the future, whatever I will do to be calm. I don't want money, wealth, or anything else. I feel tired of all that. What about the parents at home? I hope and continue to pray that they will be okay, with or without me. I've been too embarrassed to complain about my problems with them, I'm ashamed every word I give is bad news to them. I am ashamed about me failing to be a proud child for them. I'm sorry about them. Even though after I think I think I have a good environment here, I feel accepted here, whatever I do there is still a smile that returns me. I have a mother figure like Mrs. ros who I always call mama, a Kaka figure like ka ira who is good and caring here with me, I have friends like dedi who still want to be friends with me regardless of what I have done, I have a leader who cares about his members even though I have disappointed him many times. I am so grateful to have met them. I apologize to everything already and the umpteenth time disappointed them. I'm really sorry. Whoever ultimately receives this message, I believe we should have time to chat face to face to be more open, I'm sorry it's just that I'm too closed and can not share the story of my burden.

Long story short I was diagnosed with anxiety ten years ago , insomnia, and ptsd. My psychiatrist has had me on lexapro and 1mg Klonopin for a year now ( I tried 6 other antidepressants and nothing has worked through the years). Lexapro still doesn’t work like I would like and my OB said I can’t take the Klonopin, which I mainly just use to fall asleep . I was also diagnosed with chronic inomnia and have been hospitalized for it before for not being about to fall asleep- longest was 7 days.

I just started my second trimester and my resting heart rate has been a constant 100-110 and that’s do nothing but sitting if I get up and move around it can go as high as 120. That’s when I would usually take a Klonopin ( before pregnancy)

Is high heart rate harmful for the baby? I’m definitely going to talk to my OB about this this week but can’t stop thinking about it now.

1jqti3b,Here's my Anxiety Story - Help me reframe.,"Here's my story... 51/M.

I've got a great life. Wife,kids,great job, financially well off. Kids are graduating high school and i do well at work, but its boring. I have great job, but I can do it with my eyes closed it. Very boring. 

I've had a tough last year with 2 panic attacks in Jan 2024, and a bunch of anxiety/depression/dpdr to follow. ( This had NEVER happened to me before) Literally for what feels like the last decade (at least), I been waking up 2-5 times/nt to pee. Ringing in the ears(tinnitus) as well. Gained \~30 lbs over last 5 years. Father passed away in Jan 2022. Lots of stress.

I was put on an antidepressant Lexipro back in Feb 2024. Didn't like how it felt, so been on Trintellix since last fall. Went and got sleep apnea test in Dec 2024, and voila sleep apnea. CPAP has been helping, but not 'there' yet. Not sure if Trintellix is best for me either. 

No real depression now, but still lots of anxiety.  I read a few posts on here, and I feel like I'm stuck in freeze mode maybe?

I am very afraid to be alone. No idea why. I travel for work a bunch, and as I look forward to those times i get very nervous about it. Even when I'm home without the wife and kids I  get panicky. I have a therapist who is great, and when we talk I use the reference that 'what happens if i drive off the bridge'? He always says, ""you've driven over many bridges in your life, and you've never done it or thought about it, so good chance it's not going to happen.""

I'm worried about being alone, as if I may do something to cause myself self harm. I've never planned anything. I've never seriously thought about it. But I can't convince myself that I won't. When I don't feel anxious, I feel anxious about why I don't feel anxious. 

Looking for some reassurance/guidance. Thanks all.

I am diagnosed with OCD and anxiety and have been experiencing some discomfort with fandom content consumption and I’m wondering if it’s OCD/anxiety related or something anyone else has experienced.

I like to look at pictures, fanarts, analytic posts, fanfiction and other things in that genre. Sometimes I get deeply uncomfortable in a way I can’t really describe when consuming that content. It almost feels like shame or embarrassment, but not quite. It’s like a discomfort with how much I enjoy the thing I’m obsessing over and occasionally gives me general anxiety symptoms like a racing pulse. We It seems to be worse when I look a pictures or gifs (of characters, actors, ect) or fanarts.

1jnbn1f,Please help,"I just got done hanging out with some friends and I’ve never felt a more excruciating pain afterwars. I cannot be free for the life of me. I become a giant ball of anxiety any time I interact with a human and I don’t know if I could be happy as long as I’m like this.

When I start talking to someone, I immediately get in my head. I start to overthink literally everything. My words, mannerisms, the tone in my voice, etc etc. I have absolutely no confidence in the things that I say or do. It’s like what I say goes through a filter every time before I say or do it. After every conversation it’s a huge headache and sore throat from all the forcefulness I put on my voice just to make myself try to sound good. I’ve also always had a fear of being awkward or boring but the steps I take to avoid that do more harm than good.

I don’t know why I keep drawing to this. A part of the overthinking comes from me not able to think in the first place. I’m in a constant dissociated state and it feels like I could never even think about anything, so I force myself to. 

I genuinely don’t know how I can live like this anymore. I avoid social settings because of the amount of stress I get and A simple conversation can be the most painful thing in the world to me. My brain feels like mush after talking to anyone. I feel so embarrassed after each conversation because instead of seeming funny or confident I just feel cringe and awkward and I beat myself up afterwards lot. Sometimes I wish I could just ask people “Did I seem this way” or apologize for my behavior but that’d be worse.

1jnest4,Should i tell my psychiatrist i haven’t fully stuck to my treatment plan and took benzos differently than prescribed?,"
I’m 21 (F) and was recently diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety. I also developed some obsessive-compulsive behaviors, though I haven’t been diagnosed with OCD. About 2.5 weeks ago, I started Prozac (20mgs) . It’s helped a bit with sleep, but not much with my thoughts, and I’ve noticed it’s made me more impulsive with benzo use.

Before Prozac, I only used Xanax occasionally for panic attacks or presentations, being cautious about addiction. But after starting Prozac, my psychiatrist prescribed diazepam for sleep, instructing me to taper from 10 mg to 5 mg. Since Prozac made me drowsy, I didn’t need the benzo at night and instead took it when I felt upset—some days none, some days 10 mg, and occasionally 20 mg. I don’t think I’m addicted, but I might’ve built some tolerance because a small Xanax dose recently didn’t help at all.

Although Prozac has reduced my daily anxiety, I still struggle with bad news or stressful situations. On bad days, I either take diazepam to cope or don’t want to get out of bed. I was like this before meds, but I always feared I was overreacting. I even kept a diary to prove to myself that my struggles were real. I constantly worry I’m exaggerating or won’t be taken seriously.

When I was younger, I had self-harm tendencies, which stopped around 18-19, but I still don’t handle difficult emotions well. My impulse to take benzos when upset doesn’t seem severe enough to mention, and I fear my psychiatrist will just tell me to see a therapist—which my insurance doesn’t cover.

Would it be a bad idea to be upfront about all of this at my next appointment?",2025-03-30 18:24:14,2,2,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jnest4/should_i_tell_my_psychiatrist_i_havent_fully/,tell psychiatrist havent fully stuck treatment plan took benzos differently prescribed ?,0.205,0.755,0.04,-0.9951,unknown
1jn09o3,How do I stop trusting astrology or not take it serious? It's really messing my PMDD and anxiety,"

I have always been a very curious person since childhood and this has really caused pain in my life now because of astrology. I hate uncertainty this has greatly contributed to my PMDD.


I have been having some physical or mental health issues for past 7 years - since my marriage. I have been to countless doctors and astrologers to tell me everything is okay ( except for pcos and PMDD). But I would still have a fear that something  might go wrong. 

Doctors prescribed me anxiety meds  for my PMDD but I refused to take as I felt it came from outside not inside and also I have pcos so was fearing (again) that it might increase my insulin resistance and increase my symptoms. Recently I saw a good gynecologist and she agreed with me that it would have made my hormone and anxiety worse so trying therapy with some medication which will support my mood and hormones might be better - i have an appointment with her soon. My PMDD flares up during  ovulation and period. I make most of my shitty decisions during this time. 

Coming back to the astrology part. So I saw this Shady astrolger guy whom my FIL recommended saying that he was too good. I spoke to him over phone in 2020 and 2021- he said my whole life looks okay no concerns except for issues due to medication - fatefully I had an penicillin allergy and I was hospitalized for 10 days with some serious infection - with doctors help and prayers i came out of it.

Fast forward 2024 - I have had a rough year professional (bullied at work), personally (ignored my cousins for no god darn reason) and all these impacted my mental health and my PMDD through the roof. My intuition said no but I still spoke to this Shady guy again and this time as well he said everything was okay and I pressed him asking for solution and he said someone might have used black magic against me or my husband so that we are not happy that why I have faced problems since my wedding. Coincidentally my husband and I had some crazy exs who have stalked us post wedding and tried to interfere in our wedding as well. But it all done and dusted by 2017 itself. This Shady guy also said that for 12 years I will become more mentally unstable and he cannot guarantee good results.

Now my anxious brain started worrying- what 
if these come true to like meds issue he predicted?what if? What if? The manifesting trend really put me into a loop. Even if everything is okay, what if I manifesting something bad because of what this guy has said? Is it just me or everyone tried.of the thought manifestation? That's really adding on to my anxiety.


Same guy who said everything looks good started saying that everything looks bad and wanted my to pay 14500 for some yantra and he said the effect with help me through the 12 years.

I was married in 2020 and 2021 as well, I started wondering why he din bring it up then. So I said I will skip this and pray to God a d need his blessings. This guy responded how "" can I bless you if your fate is like this? I have given a solution and you should accept it. Let fate happen as it should and all the best""

I completely lost it. I should have listened to my initution and not seen this guy. Try have faith my myself and not some random shady guy.

I am trying medication, therapy and this astrology as a route to fogure out my PMDD which came out of no where. I feel like I shouldn't have encouraged this conversation. I would think anyone can bless anyone for a good life irrespective of what lies ahead. This astrologer response really was not okay - even to bless? 

I am also blaming myself to be in this situation. Trusting someone else about my life and believing it's true seems like I have low confidence and self esteem. My mind is asking why can't I see all the good predictions and trust the doctors. Why get hooked on to this one bad instance? I think all my pain is psychosomatic and my anxiety is making me do this.

I got major trust issues as I grew up in a joint family and every decision of mine was constantly validated by 10 other adults since childhood. So instead of trusting one.astrologer I keep seeking one after another till I hear want I want to hear. Also my family would never support me during  conflicts always taking my husband's side. Also they dismissed my PMDD and pcos saying I am making it all up. 


Now I am lying awake at 4.30 am in the morning and worrying what if I manifest severe mental health issues myself - one top.of the existing ones. Since this astrologer knows about my name date and time if birth can he do harm to me through any black magic? ( see my mind spinning)

Has anyone encountered such  situations ? Will I be okay? Do all astrologer predictions come true?? Please share your experience and   support me with your kindness and gentle word. Thank you so much in advance for reading my rant and guiding me here.

I need hope please.

additionally, what i don't understand is that during both of these times, i didn't really have a big stressor. i did have some things going on but none of it would have pushed me to this extent. i keep feeling weighed down by these intrusive thoughts and i'm not sure how to distract or get rid of them. they really bother me, especially when i'm trying to sleep. i wonder if anyone else had these thoughts before or know any advice on how to get them to stop? i'd appreciate it!

1j8k9g4,Sorry if this is a trauma dump. Just a question. Feel free to move along if too long🙂,"Am I the only one who wants the strength to end it all? I am afraid to die because of what is or isn’t on the other side. I have done some bad stuff in my life, I’ve never harmed anyone, I used to be a Pastor but lost my faith for awhile. Not sure where it is right now. I desperately want to believe like I used to but “looking behind the curtain” of church politics killed my faith. I do believe in Jesus but now I worry that God is just waiting for me to die to punish me. I know it sounds stupid but it’s where I am at. 

My mother, brother and great grandfather all committed suicide. My mother and brother was all I had in this world. My brother was my hero and best friend. It sounds like a tragic movie but the last time we saw each other we got into a huge fight. We used to talk everyday but after the fight we didn’t talk for months. My mom begged me to call him because she was worried but my anger stopped me. He did not commit suicide because of it, he lost his wife, kids and job, but I failed him. I have daily nightmares over it, they never stop, always the same. I watch him die over and over. I’m tired of waking up either sweating or yelling about it. 

My mom left about a year later, she couldn’t handle the pain. I used to hate them for it but lately I wonder if they were the strong ones instead of me. 

Our father was extremely abusive growing up and left when I was 8. It messed us all up. I have seen multiple psychiatrists but they all warn me that if I say I want to harm myself they will hospitalize me. I have a loving wife but we joke that she is “allergic” to weakness. I guess you can call me a “man’s man”. I played football, and coached for 30 years. I used to be very athletic and fearless. I’m on 4 Klonopins a day but feel no relief. Talking is a waste of money and time. I have a chronic and progressive muscle disease with relentless pain and extreme acid reflux. I refuse pain meds because both my mother and brother were addicted to them. Surgery is not an option for my Gerd due to the disease. I barely eat, cannot drink or use cannabis due to dyspepsia and Gerd. I lost hope a long time ago. I wonder if I’m just delaying the inevitable. I wonder if the fear will wear off. 

I believe it’s possible to be two things at once. You can be afraid or death but not excited to live. Am I the only one afraid of God? That is my question. Thank you 🙂

1jcom31,"Do you tend to face your anxieties head-on, or avoid them? What's been your experience?","Hey everyone,

I was listening to a podcast about Internal Family Systems (IFS) and the guest mentioned how some people have a strong tendency to confront things that make them anxious, almost as a way to ""test"" themselves. It made me realize that's something I've always done, but it's not always the best approach.

I'm curious, do you find yourself drawn to face your anxieties head-on, or do you tend to avoid them? What's been your experience with either strategy? Has it been helpful, harmful, or a mix of both? I'd love to hear your thoughts and learn from your experiences.

1jskxr6,Sleep and Impending Doom,"Hi, all. This is just a vent post, so do with it what you will. Anyways.

I usually sleep really poorly, as I'm falling asleep around eleven/eleven-thirty and waking up at six. I could sleep worse, but it's hard because I'm currently in school. I wake up each morning and I feel exhausted. Part of it is anemia but a lot more comes from being anxious as I'm lying in bed.

As I'm going to bed, I often look around in the dark and think that someone could be standing just outside my door or my window watching me. I'm scared to get up and use the bathroom at night sometimes or to open my closet and change if I'm hot because I'm scared someone will be hiding there.

Don't get me wrong. I love the nighttime. I always have. I love the way that the stars and moon become visible at night. I love the feeling of being wrapped tightly in blankets to go to sleep. I love darkness.

But as I've gotten older, I feel less and less able to sleep, even in the peace of the night. I can't sleep well if I can see any door — closet door or bedroom door (if it's dark outside of my room) — open in the nighttime. If I can, I just know that someone is standing there in the dark, waiting to harm me if I get out of bed.

I hate people touching my bed. My family is moving to New Zealand and our realtor touched my bed and pillow and blankets, and it gives me so much anxiety because I know that her germs (even though I'm sure her hands were clean) touched my bed. My bed feels like the only safe place in my house at night because if I stay in bed, I know no one can hurt me. But I still feel so much anxiety when I try to sleep even though my bed feels safe. What if I must use the bathroom at night? What if I need to grab a stuffed animal that fell off my bed? What if I need to pace because I can't sleep?

I take melatonin, but I'm not on meds so I can't do anything about this creeping anxiety when I'm trying to sleep. Melatonin can't put me to sleep. It takes over an hour for me to fall asleep, whether I take it or not. I might be lying here for two and half hours because I just can't sleep. My only idea is that SSRIs might help because serotonin is involved in sleep. My mom doesn't believe me, though, that my anxiety is this bad.

I don't know how to express to my mom that my anxiety is really bad. I have words, but I can't say them whenever she asks. She has a tendency to ask as if it's a challenge to me. It's a challenge I feel I can't beat. I have a hard time expressing my thoughts aloud, so here's my explanation that I wish I could give: 

I can't control my anxiety. I always feel this sense of creeping doom. At some point, this impending doom will be very present doom. It will hit and I won't be able to do anything about it. I don't sleep well because I'm afraid that someone is waiting for me to get out of bed so that they can do something bad to me. I want to be able to control it. I want to be able to sleep and study with more ease. I want to not be scared and see a need to hide all the time. I'm scared that you'll for, that I'll die, that one of my sisters will die, that dad will die, that someone will be kidnapped or assaulted or a billion other things. I'll fail my classes. You'll hate me if I don't do everything perfectly. You'll hate me if I make a single mistake. I know it's not true, any of my fears, but they're not just fears to deny their reality and move on. They're in my head. I can't face them and won't because they'll always win, even if I manage to hold it off temporarily.

I wake up s lot of mornings with a feeling of impending doom. So far, doom hasn't met us in any of the ways I feared and fear. But the feelings there when I wake. I think most of my issues would be stopped by an SSRI medication: born depression and anxiety symptoms would hopefully be at least somewhat reduced, which would be a huge improvement.

But Mom doesn't get my problems. She doesn't understand the extent of the anxiety or the severity. And my dad won't have me on medications without my mom's approval as well.

I just want to be able to sleep, y'all. I want to be able to sleep without fearing that horrible things will happen while I'm sleeping. I don't want the constant feelings of doom.

I'm scared of how I'd change on medication — anxiety affects all parts of my life so it feels like it's a very major part of me. What will be left if I'm not anxious anymore?

1j613zv,"Stopped taking Escitalopram/Lexapro a month ago, since then I have been SO emotional (sad and angry)","So my pyschiatrist and I made the decision to taper off Escitalopram bcz I wanted to see if it would help with my sexual dysfunction issues and possibly start something different, like Prozac (Doc said that it affects intimate stuff a little less than lexapro). As of right now, we have not added a new SSRI because I wanted to see how it would be since I have been on them for a solid continuous 10 years. 
But I feel like ever since then, my emotions have been so erratic and extreme. Like anything that is marginally sad, I tear up. When I get irritated, it is very extreme and worrisome. I have essentially been off of the Lexapro for a little more than a month now and I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this?
My anxiety has been kind of manageable but I am becoming anxious about these feelings because I do not want to harm any relationships in my life with my irritatibility.
I am still on other meds that I have been on for a long time, so basically no other medicine changes aside from adding methyl-folate. I take bupropion, gabapentin, clonidine, birth control, Vitamin D (have a deficiency), B-Complex Vitamin and Folate.

1jrjkvx,New and in need for improvement tips,"Hey all. This is my first time writing about my anxiety in an actual forum dedicated to it, in hopes of self improving. I have seperation anxiety, health anxiety and just basic anxiety as it is (according to the state of day or weather, or where I am)
I'll have around 3 sections in this post, it being 
-when it started.
-how it affects me now.
-needing tips and advices. (Most important)
You can skip the first two, the most important for me is the last.

My story:
Im very embarassed to admit but I've been having anxiety problems for years now without actually considering reaching out for help, from people who know how it feels actually and what could help it. I only recently started practicing mental hygiene thanks to my girlfriend. 
Last year I had a huge burn out from school and family life, thanks to staying up until 1am to animate my project works, to going to the gym 3 times a week, doing a ,,diet,"" (diet on the weekends were like, drinking a coffee, going to the gym eating a chocolet bar, going home drinking an energy drink, eating a soup, and thats it.) keeping up a social life with friends and family, working on my passions, etc, etc. Suddenly, I had a mental break down out of nowhere. I had several panic attacks a week, I ruined my menstruation cycle from stress, and got a urinary tract infection. It as it was didn't make me too concerned, I took my antibiotics, and kept up my harmful habits. Then, I got a second one. I attempted to cure it myself, only to end up in great pain and a horrible kidney infection. My mistake was coming up on Reddit, reading horror stories about this infection, and I instantly became paranoid because of others stories. I tought I have reoccuring uti infections (I didn't actually, my body was at its lowest at that point and I very easily caught sicknesses and infections), and for straight months, even like half a year, I had constant anxiety attacks. Every single week. I wasnt 18 at that Time, and I couldnt reach out for a mental doctor. My friends and family watched me slowly decay myself into a not sleeping, eating mess. Their lack of support was kinda one of the reasons I went so low, but I dont blame them for being annoyed with me. In the summer I started slowly healing out from it, into just having obsessive behavior like, not drinking coffee or eating spicy food, drinking 4 liters of water to make sure Im never gonna catch anything. Still, when I needed to go to the toilet a bit more often or feeling the slightest sting while urinating had me in a deep spiral. Then, on my 18th birthday I decided that its time I put myself together because no one else will. 

Now: I started improving my life by doing selfcare, building my social circle, my looks and hobbies. I started getting better. I only had 1 attack a month that lasted for several days at a time. 
Then I started dating my girlfriend. That fact (she didn't know about this anxiety of mine) had me cured from it like in 2 months. I dont know how, but it just happened subconciussly. My mind became a lot less tense and I became free to live my life, atleast almost. I realised I still have anxieties and I want to be able to manage them without being reliant on my lover. I get health anxiety from lung infections, needing to take antibiotics, and yes, herpes now. I have a cold sore and I become insanely paranoid of possibly giving it to my girlfriend. Shes being very supportive about it, she does whatever I ask her to, like to go wash her face (I kissed her forehead with my almost completely healed sore (just a red spot above my lips, no open wound or anything, the skin is red like its being irritated) after I kiss her forehead, wash up before and after sex (Shes not taking this bed rule seriusly, I need to make her go) and to take my cranberry supplements after the do for 3 days. 

Seperation anxiety.
Well. Its hard to explain properly without seeming lame, but here we go. Whenever she goes offline while being with her friends, I get anxius. Is there a reason? No. I just do it, and I dont know why. It lasts for a few hours until it settles down.

Basic anxiety.
Well. Thats usually after an attack, or it might be a part of my days long attacks in its final, calm state. I get anxius when I get home. Yeah, there is no reason why its that way, but it is. I sit down in my room, (which is kinda dark, even with my three lamps on) and I immediatly get anxius. Usually going out from the house to go shopping with my parents, or exercise helps. The problem is, I have my final exams coming on, and I have to learn on my computer, which is hard while being anxius, in my room alone. 

I get anxius when the sun starts going down.
Once again, I dont know why its that way. Its not all the time though, only when im stressed.


Advices:
I decided I want to completely get better, for myself, for her and for my loved ones. I need good advices and practices when it comes to anxiety, like how to manage health anxiety, seperation anxiety and just anxiety in general. Breathing exercises are absolutely worthless in my case, once I start doing them I just end up hyperventilating. The 333 rule is kinda doing it but its not the best, sadly. 

What do you guys do? What would you recommend in my case? Is depending on my girlfriends support a bad idea?",2025-04-04 21:53:52,1,0,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jrjkvx/new_and_in_need_for_improvement_tips/,new need improvement tips,0.131,0.726,0.143,0.9698,high
1jrg0p0,I’m 23 and feel so pressured by my family,"I’m 23, married, own my own home and an ex nurse. I recently left nursing to take a year out at my own expense to think about what I want to do next as I couldn’t bare working as a nurse for the rest of my life. So instead of wasting more time I’ve took some time out and thinking about returning to university this sept to study occupational therapy. 

But unfortunately my dad isn’t happy with this. (For some perspective he is one of those stereotypical rich men who, if you’re not working 60 hours a week, you’re doing something wrong). And I know I’m 23 and literally married but it causes me so much stress and anxiety. Every time I go visit I get a 30 minute lecture that brings me to tears about how he thought I was the child who was going to do something with my life and that my decision to leave nursing has “really upset” him etc etc he even lectures my husband about me and how I need to “buck my ideas up”. I just know he’ll be sat in his office rn, furious, thinking about this. Me taking a year off living on savings while I decide what I want to do has send him into a spiral. I just nod along and take it on the chin, pointless trying to defend myself as if just makes everything more stressful then it already is. 

Ultimately, I know deep down he’s doing it because he’s worried for me. He wants me to have a set, stable career, regardless whether I like it or not, due to the absolute financial shit show that is the uk. And I understand where he’s coming from but feel he is going the wrong way about it. The pressure he has me under is astronomical. I feel like I can’t function properly and need to pussyfoot around him and tell little white lies to keep him off my back. And I know many people will suggest telling him how I feel but that will only do more harm than good. He’ll just tell me to toughen up.

1jfyw6h,Seeking advice on how to stop biting lips/skin picking.,"Hi all. I am 20F and have struggled with anxiety and depression for around 10 years now. Within the last year or so, I’ve developed a really bad habit of biting/chewing the outside and inside of my lips. At first it was minor, but it’s gotten to the point where I do it subconsciously. It greatly affects my confidence because my lips are visually very bitten and not smooth. It can cause the inside of my mouth to be sensitive as well. I will have times where I stop and let the skin heal over and my confidence comes back, but then I will slip up and do it again. I’ll bite a small portion of my lip, and because I already bit a little bit, I’ll end up biting all over because I “already slipped up so what’s the harm”. I also struggle with picking the skin on my scalp, specifically in down time when others aren’t around. It causes a lot of insecurity and I need help! Does anyone else struggle with this or have any tips on how to work on stopping? I don’t want to permanently damage my skin.

1jr6t78,I need coping strategies,"TW:>!Self harm and suicide!<

I am brand new to Reddit so I'm not really sure how it works or if I'm doing this right. I am currently in high school and while I don't know everyone's high school experiences, I know that it is generally a rough time for many people and sometimes people ""grow out"" of a lot of the issues that they have in high school. But for me recently, what I believe to be my anxiety has gotten out of hand. I often have panic attacks during/after classes and it feels like I cannot breathe. I have been taught about anxiety management in the past, but nothing I do seems to help. I try deep breathing, meditation, and other things. I feel like my issues have more to do with my habits rather than specific situations where I am feeling a lot of stress, if that makes sense.

I think that my anxiety is rooted from school in general. I would not say I have a gigantic work load but I have been a perfectionist my entire life and generally aim for top grades on all of my school work. However, my perfectionism never used to prohibit my ability to have fun and enjoy life like it has recently. I feel like now my anxiety has gotten so out of control that I don't know how to cope. Anytime I slightly let myself or someone else down, I have a feeling of self loathing. No matter how hard I try to get ahead in my work load, there will always be an endless stress load crushing me. I often stress over grades. I tell myself that grades are just grades, and it's not the end of the world if I get a few bad grades here and there. This always gives me a few seconds of relief. That is, until I ask myself the question, ""Without overachieving, getting straight A's and making myself/others proud, who am I?"" and then I usually feel even worse about myself than before. I devote a *lot* of my time to doing school work, so naturally that shapes a large part of my life and who I am. By telling myself a few grades don't matter in order to reduce my anxiety, it feels like that part of who I am is not rational or practical at all. Of course I know that eventually I will grow out of school and it will not always be part of my identity, but I guess I always just expected it to gradually work it's way out of my life as I get into my later years. For the time being, it is part of my identity and will be for a few more years. I rely on school work and homework to be the things that bring me the most fulfillment, pride and self esteem in life. But ironically, because I rely so heavily on this and am so addicted to the feeling of satisfaction I get from school work, I also feel crushing pressure to get it done perfectly and quickly. And when I don't get it *all* done, it leads me to lowered self esteem. 

I don't know much about self harm topics or suicide besides what I have learned at school. I will not get into much detail but I do want to include that I have used self harm to cope a few times. I don't necessarily like it at all but it takes my mind off of whatever I feel emotionally, which is usually that I am not worthy of having a high self esteem or feeling satisfaction because I did not complete the tasks that I expected myself to be able to complete (this is not based on other's expectations). When the reassurance that all of my tasks are completed and out of the way is stripped away from me, that is when I am at my lowest and usually resort to unhealthy coping mechanisms. It's not like I'm looking for others to be pleased by what I do but rather I need to know that others aren't disappointed in me. I'm not sure if that's the same thing but it feels very different in my head. I try to feel a sense of fulfillment from overachieving and doing all of my work because it is one of the only ways I can feel accomplished in life. I put this pressure upon myself, neither my parents nor my teachers nor friends put this pressure on me. In a way, I'm addicted to school work because in the end I get satisfaction from knowing I worked myself to the bone and stressed myself out to the maximum and still was able to complete all my tasks. Sure, I get satisfaction in the end, but for the most part I'm drowning in stress. I recently have been viewing my life as pointless loop, because honestly to my brain it probably is. I get work assigned, I work myself to the bone to complete it, and then I have satisfaction for a few days while also being incredibly burnt out and exhausted. And in order to break this loop, I've thought about self harm and suicide. It's like I've forgotten how to just live and be happy with whatever situation I'm in. I want to be able to break this exhausting loop without using self harm as a way to escape. I want to be able to feel happy consistently, even when I have work hanging over my head. I don't enjoy these short term periods of satisfaction combined with burn out. I understand that life will not be anxiety free. There will always be anxiety, but I just don't understand how anyone is supposed to live with anxiety *and* be happy. 

I am very lucky and have everything I could ask for -- pretty good friends, an amazing family and strong support system, and enough resources. When I tell my parents about my issue, I don't think they understand how serious it's affected me for the past few months, specifically because I don't think I do a very good job of describing my issues. I have told them that I have thought about suicide and they have provided all of the love and support I could ask for, but because I'm not able to just talk about my issues off of the top of my head to them very easily, it's hard for them to understand why I'm feeling this way. My anxiety spills over to other areas of my life to the point where it feels that I am just going through the motions in life without trying to actually get anything out of my experiences. I'm always looking forward to any type of ""break"" from my anxiety, only to find that there is always something else that causes me more anxiety. I want to enjoy life again. Does anyone relate to this? If so, what are some good, healthy ways of coping?

1jimu2k,Any experiences of Zoloft to deal with a prolonged external anxiety causing event? (Illness of partner),"Hello, I hope this is acceptable to post here and please accept my apologies if it isn’t. 

I have been struggling with anxiety around my wife’s illness. I am her carer alongside working a high pressure full time job and we recently learned that she will need brain surgery. I won’t get into anymore detail than that but suffice it to say the day to day stresses plus the longer term anxiety of everything takes its toll and a few times I have asked my Doctor for help when I have really felt on the edge.

Twice now my doctor has written me a prescription for Zoloft / Sertraline but something has always stopped me taking them. I didn’t have anxiety before my wife got sick, and therefore if these meds are designed to address an imbalance in the brain, they will probably do as much harm as they will do me any good, as I don’t think I do have an imbalance (despite being the type inclined to worry), I’m just dealing with a very stressful situation in my life. 

With that said, I’m once again going through a dark period. I work long hours to make enough to support us both and our daughter, my wife’s condition is not very good, and the prospect of risky surgery on the horizon is all adding up and overwhelming me. Obviously my priority is being there for my wife regardless of how I feel, but at the same time I recognise my anxiety and mental health are at a low point right now and once again I am thinking of calling my doctor and saying I’ll start taking them. 

I also feel a degree of guilt for considering taking medication - my wife has no choice but to take multiple very unpleasant medications that have awful side effects. As a result, I feel bad at the thought of electively taking something that could cause health issues for me that then become an additional burden in our household. 

I would be very grateful if anyone has experiences (positive or negative) of taking sertraline / Zoloft to deal specifically with an external stressor like family member illness, bereavement, work stress etc but without having previously diagnosed anxiety disorder. Did it help you? I do trust my doctor but the whole brain chemistry imbalance theory of SSRIs makes me think these drugs are not meant for me.

1jnk8xl,Long-term Promethazine use for anxiety – anyone with experience?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been dealing with intense anxiety and panic attacks for several years. A few months ago, my mother picked up Promethazine 100mg/ml (oral drops) for me, because I was experiencing panic attacks almost hourly, lasting around 30 minutes each.

My general practitioner has been unavailable for a longer period, so I’ve continued taking Promethazine for about 3 months now, at a low dose of 2 drops in the morning and 2 drops at night.

I know it’s not physically addictive like benzodiazepines, but I sometimes read that it’s only meant for short-term use – which worries me.
At the same time, it helps me so much, I honestly don't know how I would have managed the past months without it.

On weekends, I don’t even take it because I’m not alone at home then, so I usually take it just 5 days a week.

I’m wondering if anyone here has experience with long-term Promethazine use for anxiety or panic?
Have you used it for months or even years? Did you run into any problems, side effects, or tolerance?

Maybe I’m overthinking it, but I’d really appreciate hearing from people who’ve been in a similar situation.
It would be a shame if it caused long-term harm, but stopping it abruptly also scares me.

Thanks so much in advance!",2025-03-30 22:22:31,2,0,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jnk8xl/longterm_promethazine_use_for_anxiety_anyone_with/,longterm promethazine use anxiety anyone experience ?,0.158,0.758,0.083,-0.9472,moderate

When I was facing cardiac anxiety, YT and strangers in forums like this one, helped more than any therapist could. I am sharing below some questions I will be asking. If you have any questions please share in comments:

1. Can repeated panic attacks or frequent palpitations harm the heart over time?
2. How reliable are tests like ECGs, echocardiograms, and Holter monitors in detecting real heart issues?
3. What are the harmless ECG changes commonly seen during a panic/anxiety attack?
4. At what point should someone stop getting repeated heart tests and focus on managing their anxiety instead?
5. What is your advice to those who constantly seek medical reassurance but still doubt their results?
6. What are some key differences between the sensations of a heart attack and a panic attack?
7. If all tests are normal, but I still have chest pain or palpitations, when should I next visit my cardiologist for a check up
8. Do long-term beta blockers weaken the heart
9. What role do lifestyle factors play in protecting the heart despite ongoing anxiety?

1jhx386,Anxiety feeds my depression and I spiral,"I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few times. But it started when I was in high school. Or the worst of it started in high school. I started having panic and anxiety attacks before school so severe I laid on the floor, dressed for school but unable to move, barely able to catch my breath and feeling like a complete and utter failure. After about two to three weeks of this I was pulled from the public school system, and later enrolled in an online public school a town over. Things settled down, I started medication and moved on with my life. Graduated high school and moved out of state when I was 18 with my then boyfriend. We got married and had two kids. I have stayed home with them since. My oldest is now seven and I started contract work about two to three weeks ago. At first the anxiety and panic attacks were less common, but still happened. I could find a way to calm myself and settle into the new normal of my job. But the last couple days? It feels like I’m stuck. My anxiety is filling me with panic, fear and dread. Then feeding my depression that I’m alone and I can fight or I can cave and let the world gobble me up. I had a panic attack two nights ago before bed. Dread from work and the inevitable of having I go to work. Then I woke up crying and shaking. Called in sick. Same routine for the last three days. But today I thought I could force myself to go to work and push through. I cried the whole drive ( which is an hour long). Sat in the parking lot for thirty minutes going in circles in my head. Anxiety telling me my kids are unhappy and struggling and it’s my fault. That the work day is going to get worse. That regardless of what I do I will inevitably cause harm to my husband. He works full time at the same place I am doing contract work. Then it feeds the depression. The depression reminds me I’m alone. That the schedule of our day doesn’t allow me to feel or process the anxiety. I just have to keep moving, but I’m weak and a coward. That my husband will leave me and I’m nothing. That k will never compare to the female coworkers that he has. There’s something wrong with me but I can’t fix it. That I’ll never fix it. And I’ll be stuck forever. That I’ll always trap those around me. I’m just a burden to all those I care about. Then the anxiety ramps up again. That my husband will want to leave me because I have embarrassed him. Making everyone’s life more difficult and I’m failing at stepping up when I want and need to. That if I can’t do it now then I’ll never be able to step up. I’m just stuck. I feel alone and like a failure and my mind won’t stop the circle cycle of anxiety -> depression -> anxiety -> depression.

I've just joined this reddit and I think I should asks you a question that remains unanswered:

I recently felt really drained of my energy and had some harmful thoughts towards some people. Please note that I'm a person that won't even replicate even if I'm being struck physically. That's how much I hate physical violence. 

After having thise thoughts, a big pike of stress hitted me and I was starting to think to myself that I was so dumb for thinking about these kind of things. Then, that's where the thought of ending it all came. 

Of course, having that thought shook me to the deepest. 

I've spoke to my psychologist that I'm seeing every 2 weeks about it and she told me that dark thoughts like these needs to be adresses but it just stresses me out as I'm thinking that since I've had these thoughts, it's just gonna go downhill and they will slowly grow on me.

After experiencing an anaphylactic shock from almonds—which I had always tolerated before—and a severe, prolonged illness (Covid-19) in May last year, followed by numerous medical tests and hospital stays without any findings…
I have changed from an extroverted, strong, and confident man—a martial artist—into an anxious, overthinking, and lost person who has moved back in with his parents.

I managed to overcome some symptoms of anxiety and obsessive thoughts, but many still persist and are exhausting.

Current Medication:
	•	2x Candesartan Amlo 16/5
	•	2x Esomeprazole 40mg
	•	Sertraline 50mg for one week
	•	1x Allegra

Upcoming Hospital Stay:

Next week, my inpatient treatment in a psychiatric clinic begins. The psychosomatic ward is full, and the waiting time is three months, so according to my first consultation, I will be placed in the psychiatric ward, where they believe I can also receive the help I need.

My Struggles & Fears:

I have isolated myself. I am afraid of social contact, afraid that every person means harm to me.
I feel extremely uncomfortable sharing a room with a stranger, worrying about possible assaults or boundary violations. At the same time, I am afraid of being alone. I fear making the wrong decision.

I want to find and reclaim my old self, but the fear of the unknown is overwhelming… My thoughts are spiraling, and I don’t feel entirely safe with this decision.

1j73a59,Pain helped with my Anxiety??,"So, I'm 22M, currently suffering from Agoraphobia and Panic Disorder. I can't even leave my home for doctors appointment anymore, however, I've been making steady progress towards not having panic attacks every single day, and leaving my house little by little with some self made exposure therapy.

I'm medicated (Escitalopram 20Mg daily, Sulpan for crisis) and doing therapy with a psychoanalyst every week. However, today was one of those days where anxiety was a constant background feeling, the constant burning behind my chest and light-headedness all day, I was low-key distressed the whole time, I wasn't feeling well enough to have relations, even.

At the end of the day my girlfriend decided to pop the pimples in my back using a tool she just recently bought. It hurt, a lot, I am quite sensitive. I even went a little angry when I asked her to stop and she didn't stopped immediately. However, that constant agony I was feeling dissipated a little bit. I asked her to do it again, just to be sure, and sure enough, I relaxed, I just woke up from a 3h nap.

I did a little reading and found that the pain areas of the brain share a lot of pathways with the fear neural pathways, as pain can cause the central nervous system to release endorphins, which block pain and can induce feelings of relaxation.

Please be weary that I am NOT advocating for self-harm!!!

I've had my past experiences with self-harm at age 14, when I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression, and that hasn't been part of my life as a coping mechanism ever since and I DON'T recommend it to anyone!

Anyway, I've read that pain that's relevant to the source of anxiety can make anxiety worse, while pain that's not relevant to the source of pain can reduce anxiety. When I have panic attacks I hold down ice cubes as long as I can (that I can safely recommend to anyone suffering with panic), and that helps a lot, I thought it was because of the cold, but I guess it's more about redirecting my focus to the pain.

Is there any other ways I can use this to my advantage? Maybe help with my agoraphobia? Have anyone experienced something similar? Please share your thoughts!

I've spent months feeling different, as if I can no longer see my past with the same eyes. I know that before, it didn't affect me because I simply didn't see it as something harmful, but now my brain insists that it should have been a problem from the start.

I keep wondering if what happened was always bad and I just didn't realize it, or if it was just this intrusive thought that triggered everything. Has anyone else experienced something like this? How did you stop overthinking it or go back to how you were before?

After going through this mentally, I stopped enjoying the things I love, I didn’t feel worthy of what I did, and I stopped seeing myself as a good person or deserving of anything.

I've been like this for over five months.",2025-03-08 08:04:27,1,1,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1j69sw4/anxiety_ruined_the_way_i_see_myself/,anxiety ruined way see,0.124,0.771,0.105,0.4606,unknown
1jaiw25,My friends anxiety is really affecting me,"I want to preface this by saying i also have pretty severe anxiety, i am medicated and have done loads of therapy for it. I have also done sessions that have specifically been about making sure my mental health is impacting the people around me as little as possible. 

My friend does regular talk therapy, its not cbt, nor dbt. mainly focused on venting about their worries and everything going on it their life. i’m proud of them for being able to open up to someone and having that support.  the issue is, they’re not learning coping mechanisms for their anxiety and other mental health struggles.

i am their closest friend, and im very proud to be so. they are an amazing person and my soulmate. i do not think they recognize how much their anxiety impacts me. having to constantly support them  in public to make sure they’re not going to have an anxiety or panic attack, being on the watch 24/7 for any triggers to the point that im having to be less aware of my own anxiety triggers to make insure they’re comfortable. being snapped at because they’re stressed out, reminding them they don’t have to checking their watch every other minute (they have debilitating time anxiety). always being rushed or reminded of the time if we’re doing stuff, having to limit my social interaction with people when i’m with them. i am constantly on the watch for their anxiety levels, to the point that it severely increases my own anxiety. 

i have done my best to push them to go to a doctor (which they have! i’m so proud of them, little progress has actually been made when it comes to treating them medically). i’ve also tried to convince them to go to another therapist, along with the one they’re already seeing. i’ve tried to teach them more coping mechanisms, their fear of it not working or making it worse has stopped them from even trying. i am stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

i even recognize that bringing this up to them will cause them to shut me out mentally and emotionally, and i cannot keep doing this. it is so exhausting to have to be at the brunt of it. i cannot keep listening to every anxious thought they have, it makes me have to mentally prepare myself to spend time with them because of it. i’m starting to hold resentment

do you guys have any advice on how to approach this? i don’t want to trigger them more, and i have to start putting myself and mental health first. i do not intend to end the friendship unless i bring it up and there is no attempt to find better resources to help and become less reliant on me, or they don’t react well in an extreme manner. (ex: freaking out at me, blocking me out completely, etc) 

i love them, and i want the best for them; and i know i deserve better even though they’re not intentionally harming me. thank you!

1j9z4fs,Any Other Europeans Feeling Constantly More Anxious Lately?,"I have an anxiety disorder and am generally vulnerable to anxiety. And ever since Donald Trump started pulling back on Ukraine and publically questioning the United States' NATO commitments as president in his second term I've felt almost constant anxiety.

Russia is on the European Union's doorstep. It is currently on a war footing, while Europe is not at all. And if the war in Ukraine ends they will likely have time to recover. And what afterwards? What in two years, or three years, or four years? Somewhere before Trump's term ends. What if Putin feels this is his best shot to get the Baltic States and Poland back under Russian control?

It doesn't even need to be that he starts with an all out war. He could first try to do some more indirect things, trip up and could cause a war with all of Europe.

I'm strongly anti-war. I know how horrible war is.

We only have one life to enjoy our connections with people, beautiful art, wonderful music, sunsets. In war you can just be snuffed out for some tyrant's insane dreams.

I've seen so many videos of people returning to their homes only to see them as rubble. I look at my home now and think about how I would feel if that happened to it. A place that I helped renovate for hundreds of hours. Paid a lot of money to do so as well. Have so many memories in. They could all be destroyed.

Not to mention just the cruelty. How you can be at the mercy of people who would torture you, r\*pe you, kill you, etc.

And I don't want to kill anyone either. I am not suited to be a soldier in any way. Neither just as a person, but also because I have a strong moral objection to the idea. It is wrong to force people to fight. It is wrong to kill other people who themselves are being forced to fight.

It's all a complete horror show.

And nowadays with Europe re-arming, Trump in the White House heavily harming NATO, and Russia with a war economy, I just fear the rope we are walking is so thin. I hope so much that it never comes to war,, but if it does I have no idea what I'm going to do. I don't want any part of this.

And nowadays this stuff is almost constantly in the back of my mind. I consistently feel anxious and tense. I fear what'll happen in the future. And it all feels so fragile. And I feel powerless to do anything about it.

Any other Europeans with anxiety problems feel this way or similarly?",2025-03-13 03:16:34,2,0,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1j9z4fs/any_other_europeans_feeling_constantly_more/,europeans feeling constantly anxious lately ?,0.2,0.736,0.064,-0.9971,moderate
1j9mtlm,I can’t sleep until I physically cannot stay awake any longer,"Hi, I’m a 23(m) university student in my final year and I CANNOT sleep at a decent time unless I literally have nothing to do the next day. Strategies that I have used to deal with this are as I understand harmful to my own well being. Forcing myself to stay up all night so I don’t sleep in and miss and important class or getting less than 5 hours sleep regularly are detrimental to my health, mood and by extension my motivation to get my shit done.
I understand what causes my sleep anxiety, I have missed an exam before because I could not sleep and passed out unintentionally without setting and alarm (the memory of this is one of the first things my brain goes to when I’m struggling, which as you can imagine only makes things worse), I am also a heavy sleeper and the chances of me sleeping through an alarm even on full volume are not 0. I have slept through fire drills in my uni accommodation before.
Is there anyone else who has fallen into these destructive patterns due to sleep anxiety and if so, what were some techniques that helped you to overcome it.

1j6h47s,Explaining Anxiety to others,"So, i got diagnosed with GAD and traits of other anxiety disorders (panic, social anxiety, OCD) in summer. 
Since then, ive tried to explain it to friends and family, but it's really hard because of how different my symptoms can be. 

They range from common things like overthinking social situations, to incredibly bizzarre things like not being able to go outside because im convinced that someone will kidnap me if i do. 
Ppl always ask me what im scared of, no matter how many times I try to explain that im scared of everything all the time. For some reason no one can comprehend the fact that there's no common pattern (i. e. Fear of rejection/social anxiety, fear of death, fear of the future, etc.) that connects all my fears. 
Im scared of different things, for different reasons. And i have contradicting fears too. For example, I regularly throw away food, bc my ocd convinces me that it's rotten and contaminated and i will die if i dont throw it away. But i also then get anxious about wasting money, because financial anxiety, and about being 'a bad person' for wasting food, because of my moral ocd symptoms. 
And people really, really struggle to understand that for some reason. 

I also don't rly wanna name examples of my symptoms, because it will ever explain the full experience. 
And i also have a lot of shame surrounding my symptoms, which I've heard is common with ocd. I have a lot of 'immoral' intrusive thoughs (for example about harming others) and whenever i try to explain them, people react really badly. (""But you aren't like, gona hurt me, right?"" -thing another person with ocd told me last week after i told them about my symptoms.)

Explaining the more extreme symptoms to people helps them understand me, but it also freaks them out because of how irrational they are. (i. e. When i was conviced a ghost followed me for a year and i prayed to it every night because i was sure that if i didn't, itd kill me.)

Does anyone know how i could explain my struggles with anxiety to people, without going into detail about my symptoms? ",2025-03-08 16:26:27,1,0,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1j6h47s/explaining_anxiety_to_others/,explaining anxiety others,0.254,0.684,0.063,-0.9981,moderate

But now she has multiple on her wrist and thigh that are clearly new. When she's around me she wears shorts and short sleeves. I don't know what to do, should i bring it up and talk to her about it? Should I offer support or just be around her? She was around when I would self harm, and there would be fresh cuts. She never said anything which personally I wouldn't want her too.

1j60uzs,Self harm?idk please help tho🙏,"This post it’s more about trying to understand what’s going on
if anyone watches shows with characters that have extremely bad pasts linked with mental health because of the environment they grew up in and how they were treated/ used/ or exposed to horrible trauma it might be easier to understand what I’m trying to say

why do i feel constant need to be in these characters place? To be born with a horrible past to also have their easy life later, they get people who appreciate, understand and value them over all. What could be the reason i developed this mindset? 

 I’m well aware that: trauma+hardships ≠ future happiness

But, it still bothers me to always feel the need to get hurt and something in me just assumes this is a good thing even though I know it is not 
(please don’t cringe this is the only way I’m able to describe this)

The reason i put self harm in the title is because I did for a consistent time do self harm but i’ve been clear for a good while now about 3 months so this is a big question mark for me now",2025-03-08 00:32:57,1,0,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j60uzs/self_harmidk_please_help_tho/,self harm ? idk please help tho,0.127,0.775,0.098,-0.8271,low
1j4vacl,My wife cheated now I'm depressed and she just yells,"I (33f) had 7 miscarriages. After each one my wife (31f) screamed at me she'd cheat on me since I can't give her a kid. She would scream it's my fault, corner me as I cried, never hugged me never comforted me. I begged for a break from trying to get back to us. She refused which lead to my tubes rupturing and now cannot try again. 
She stopped talking to me after that. I almost died but she only cared about getting a kid. So she tried to carry. 
It worked the first round. She started getting super anxious.  Every person was out to get her. Neighbors wanted her ""dead"". Everything in the world was against her. She would pull knives and threaten me. She would try to kill the neighbors with the same knife that I would have to wrestle from her.
She believes if we didn't think the same as her that we weren't supportive. But no the 16 yr old smoking pot in her own apartment isn't out to harm you. 
I did everything she asked. Knocked on every door to ask ppl to refrain from doing what they legally are allowed because we are pregnant. That wasn't good enough. I bought and installed blockers on our doors and windows to block any smell she may get a whiff of. Not good enough.
I'm disabled but I took on all physical chores. I got bitched out for being in paid and passing out when it got too painful. 
When I would ask if it was okay to nap after a rough day she would say yes only to freak out after I was asleep and physically pull me from the bed. She dislocated my leg and hip and threw out my back from yanking me so hard. 
Then she cheats on me and says it's because I don't support her and am miserable.
Maybe because you never even tried to ever support me. I have given everything to support her but she only accepts blind obedience.
I begged for time to reconnect so she found several others to reconnect with while I am used to fix her mental issues and work as her slave.

1jcjpjl,Is watching gore bad for you?,"This may be a bit of a dumb question, I'm sure it does have negative impacts, but when I tried looking it up I really only found stuff about gore in movies and thats probably different than seeing actual gore.

A year or two ago I remember looking at the subreddit r/eyeblech, but then it got banned lol. I only looked at it from time to time out of curiosity so I didnt bother looking for another place to watch gore once it was banned. 

However a couple months ago the morbid curiosity came back so I began looking for places to watch it again. I found a site dedicated to posting gore, so the people on there are way worse than the people on the subreddit. Like if they're genuine about what they say then they're some of the most horrible people alive. 

I've been looking at that site almost daily ever since. I'm worried that I'll start internalizing the things said there and I'll become less empathetic. I've had a couple dreams of me violently killing people (including my family) but I want to clarify I have no desire to inflict harm on anyone. My age may also be an issue because I'm 15 and gonna turn 16 soon so my brain is still developing. It's not like I feel nothing when watching it, sometimes I feel heavy in my chest and there are some really brutal vids that are too painful to watch without looking away. 

But just how harmful is it? I have always had good mental health and it hasnt gotten worse or anything.  It just seems like it's not really impacting me much (for now).",2025-03-16 14:47:48,24,60,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jcjpjl/is_watching_gore_bad_for_you/,watching gore bad ?,0.161,0.731,0.109,-0.9729,low

1jmdcew,".3% of the world has my illness and it well, sucks","I have Scizoaffective Bipolar Type disease. I was officially diagnosed when I was 28 with it (and I just turned 32), but experience symptoms years earlier and it's very debilitating. I hate hearing voices off and on. To make it bearable I stay mostly at home, but it's not bullet proof, after months I start to hear voices in my home too and what's suppose to be my safe space, isn't quite. So right now I've been feeling normal because I haven't heard voices in 3 months, but as of this week unfortunately there's disturbances. I hear strangers outside talking about me, people I know talking, or media people talking directly to me. It's super distracting and I just want to sleep it off if possible. When I don't hear voices I'm motivated to do many things but when I do, I don't want to be awake.

I just want to vent how miserable my illness makes me. How I'm a shell of myself. How I desperately want to thrive or claim my life, but feel trapped. 

During covid everyone had to stay home. And I have to still stay home. Isolation is hard. I have online friends and that's been a lifeline of sorts. Their support plus my new therapist means so much and give me hope. 

I don't know, it's a rough morning. I wonder if I'll ever go out again in peace. It's kind of like Kristen Bell in the Netflix show The Woman Across the Street From the Girl in the Window. Once I step out it's pretty bad,  I immediately hear hallucinations and it's much more intense, I can't really focus on actual direction or conversation.

The auditory hallucinations are rarely friendly. They 9.9/10 times just tear me down or threaten me with all kinds of harm. They want me to believe I'm a monster (not like Gaga fan) and die gruesome death.

Not exactly a stranger, but 3rd person without actually viewing myself from the 3rd person.

It can be fixed, but now I've been feeling hopeless, like it isn't possible. That I can't work that hard.

More easily irritated, feeling dejected and not wanting to do anything.

It stays the same. I want to improve and be better, but I'm stuck between inaction and action. 

I keep repeating processed like washing my hands in multiples of 4, thinking about how my family is gonna die if I'm not with them etc.

1jrc6ze,Shocked at how quickly my mental health can deteriorate.,"five years ago I went through a serious mental health crisis. while at time the it seemed to come out of nowhere to me, looking back there was a prolonged period were clear stressors were all around me, from Covid lockdowns, deaths in the family, trouble at work, and a bad living situation. 

Long story short, I got put on anti-depressants, and did a little bit of therapy (definitely not enough). I stabilised, my living condiiton improved,  life continued.

And then a year ago, feeling good, i weaned off the anti-depressants, and felt it was behind me.

Then almost exactly a year later BANG i'm absolutely inundated with anxiety, as intense as when i got them 5 years ago. Thoughts of self harm which I haven't had for years immediately returned. 

The difference this time, is I can see I am starting to spiral and am reaching out for help now as opposed to just trying to ignore it like it did last time. 

But as the title says, I'm kinda stunned that these feelings which i felt were gone have flipped right back on as if someone has turned a switch in my brain. It's the suddenness!

1j7vgur,Intense anger that can last hours,"Just to be clear, I am not currently having suicidal thoughts or temptations of self-harm!!

So with that out of the way, I have increasingly gotten more and more easily angry at tiny things. It started when I was 13, of course, I know what started it is my mom's verbally/emotionally abusive asshole boyfriend. I just now got over something that happened between me and him just about an hour ago, and I'll copy and paste what I said to my friend earlier at the height of this blind rage.

*\[""Its 3 in the morning, Kasey."" ""I know, I was hungry and didn't have dinner."" ""Yeah maybe you should have dinner at a normal time. Some of us have to get up and do shit. This bullshit stops tonight."" Did you know, you have a room upstairs with a huge bed you never sleep on? Did you know, that ""Some of us"" means my mom has to go to work? Good thing she's upstairs sleeping in her bed without you! Did you know, that we actually didn't have any dinner cooked tonight? You cannot tell me to eat at a normal time when I wasn't told no one would be cooking. You have a bed yet you sleep down here. Me having a snack late at night should not bother you because you have a BED. UPSTAIRS, that you never sleep on. I wouldn't be bothering you if you actually used the shit you paied for.\]*

Then I proceeded to cuss him out to my friend and kept repeating the part about how he said ""This bullshit ends tonight."" The thing is, I barely remember typing any of this. I remember wanting SO badly to end my 8 month streak and start cutting and even stabbing my thighs, I remember wanting to wreck my room until it was unrecognizable, having very violent thoughts about him. At this point I can't ignore it, I know it's more than bottled-up anger. I've never been able to express my anger without it getting punished, so of course bottling it up probably didn't help.

But little things like him telling me to do the dishes, or my boss at work telling me to use less water when washing the dishes, it sends me into a rage or makes me want to start scream-crying. I've looked up symptoms of BPD, Bipolar, or anything similar (I know, it's not self diagnosable.) 

I don't know exactly what I'm looking for sending this, it's a rant for the most part, but advice is appreciated.

TLDR: I'm scared about my blind rage over little things, I've done research into what it could possibly be, and I know it started because of the abuse my mom's bf has put me through and me not having an outlet without being punished for it.",2025-03-10 13:22:45,1,9,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j7vgur/intense_anger_that_can_last_hours/,intense anger last hours,0.118,0.814,0.068,-0.9839,high
1jpd8io,I don’t know how to cope with these thoughts and big feelings,"⚠️TW THERE IS MENTION OF SH AND SUICIDAL INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS. ⚠️

i didn’t think i have enough details around it to give the flair for it but just message me and i’ll change it. 

Whenever I mess something up or losing something my immediate reaction is to hurt myself. I use to sh (cutting), but I am a few months clean now. I still do hurt myself, but it’s not permanent or dangerous. My brain will immediately start chatting kys, sh00t yourself, jump, etc. anything along those lines and sometimes if it’s something i lost or am around one of my family members i’ll say something like, “this really makes me want to *insert gruesome way to die* “ i literally cannot control it. the words have to come out. if i don’t say something it will become so much physically that i will hurt myself. usually the physical sensation feels like burning from the inside out and i feel like i’m suffocating. i sometimes try to explain to my mother this because she is usually the one witnessing my breakdown and she usually says “it’s not that big of a deal.” “you’re being dramatic.” “just calm down and think about.” which makes me want to do and say very mean things to her. i definitely have said mean things, but i would never do anything. i do fantasize about it during my breakdowns when she says these thing. if i’m alone i say these things out loud, hit myself, and scream, because i have zero words that can explain how i feel or help me. the only thing that clears my head in these moments are physical harm. I told my stepdad this almost to a T and he gave me a hug and said he loved me, which is nice than i’ve ever gotten from my mother. 

i really would like to know what is going on and how to help myself and how to help the people around me through what I’m going through.

After texting them, i quickly got connected to a counselor. She explain who she was and asked why I was texting 988. I told her about my self harm and how I couldn’t stop. Throughout the entire conversation I was constantly reassured that she was there for me and that her only intention was to help. I got some actual advice from her and unlike what other people say, it definitely wasnt AI (at least in my experience) i genuinely felt so incredibly heard. I was lowkey talking with AI to at least get advice and something about having a genuine human interaction made me feel just overall better.

1jjrq57,Emotional damage and 6 month traumatic rollercoaster,"Hey, 

31m here, have a history of mental health issues, undiagnosed but I’ve just been raw dogging life and struggling, haven’t really got very far. 

I was in my first proper relationship at the start of last year. Boy was it amazing, I felt so loved, and life felt amazing. Unfortunately we path had our struggles and we are equally at fault for it ending, probably just bad timing and we couldn’t help each other. 

It ended abruptly in October, she cheated right before then and then lied about it. She manipulated, and just gaslighted for months. I always knew but I guess I didn’t want to believe she could hurt me like that, we tried to be friends but I became pretty hard to deal with eventually given that I was being manipulated and started to question my sanity, I though it was all my fault. I also was made redundant in October and I my life has slowly descended into chaos. 

I found out the truth in feb officially from a friend of hers, I tried to disconnect a bunch of times and ended up in contact again. After finding out I made very clear boundaries, I said I had no interest in being her friend if she was still gonna see and sleep with the guy she betrayed me with. I know it’s weird to ask that as a friend but she kept fighting for me, and saying she loved me and cared, and I feel this connection with her and I didn’t want to loose her. She also said she didn’t want to loose me, it was always going to be a tough road, as I don’t trust her, and I get anxiety when she leaves me. She was never really down for it, my triggers kept trigger her, it’s become very toxic and we clearly are not good for each other.

Shes a pathological liar and every time she lies to me and I catch her out she gives me half the truth and replaces the lie with a new one to make her actions not seem so bad. I’m stupid and weak, I let her in and she makes me feel good again, and then when she gets the attention she gets bored and kinda just disappears. She always tells me she’s done with that guy and makes me feel sympathy for her because she’s had a rough life (which she has). 

Anyway she lied to me again tonight, she hurt me so many times over that past few months and I’m struggling to pick myself up. We keep disconnecting because I don’t want to be friends with her given her actions, and she comes back and uses me when she feels lonely, or need attention when she’s not getting it.

How do I let her go, I know now that she doesn’t really love me or care about me, but to me it’s realest thing I ever felt, and I miss her and love engaging with her, she’s makes me feel whole again. I am weak for letting her trample all over me, I’m weak for not having respect for myself and allowing myself to suffer while keeping in contact with her. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel so empty when we disconnect and I know it’s not true but I feel like I’ll never feel that feeling again, my life is in absolute chaos, every aspect of my life is destroyed, I feel like a shell of myself, I’ve been gutted. 

I self harmed for the first time in my life a month ago, I want to do it again, I don’t think I am capable of killing myself but I feelings of hopelessness, I don’t want to exist anymore.

Sorry I know this is along message and it’s probably all over the place, I can’t sleep, I can’t think, I enjoy nothing, I’m isolating and I’m scared. I don’t know how to pick myself up anymore. Please help me.

1jfeo2g,Is it because of my bpd and npd?,"My name is Lamb and I’m 19 years old, I recently got diagnosed with bpd, npd and body dysmorphia, when I got the results I didn’t care much, because I wasn’t surprised. All my life ever since I was a toddler I’ve been love bombed but then ghosted out of the blue and I could never understand WHY, LIKE WHY!? I was sweet, loving and respectful and was a good person but people just loved to put me down and ghost me when they got me attached to them. I used to sulk and let those “friends” treat me that way because I was desperate for acceptance love and friendship but it came to a point.

Because of all the heartbreak and betrayal I’ve become very bitter and just a fucked up individual, I started to become a prick who would love bomb people who wanted to be my friends, when they got attached to me I would be emotionally abusive and push them to their limits to see how far they’ll go to stay with me to argue over little things to make them angry or go off on me so they would leave me, the reason why I wanted to make them leave me was because I wanted to say “Ha I knew it, your just like all the others” to gaslight them, if they still wanted to stay in my life I would cut off all relationships or ghost them because I just can’t believe that someone would actually want to care for me or be my friend.

I’ve only had one boyfriend and it was an online one we met in a gore group chat which was on telegram (764 / 6996), I was 15 and he was 40 and he instantly fell for me, on the first day of talking he gave me his social security number, his address and all his banking information, he was my first boyfriend so I really loved him, he was extremely obsessive and attached (we were on call 24/7, even when I was sleeping, we had planned how I would run away so I could live with him, start a family and be together forever) because of my past which I just explained to you I would try to break up with him almost every other day because I was scared of him leaving me, I didn’t ask him to and would’ve never asked him to but he self harmed to make me stay and would even hurt his cat to guilt trip me into staying, he even cut my name into his skin (I cut his name into my chest too after him to show my love and devotion) all this at first scared me but then it made me happy because it made me feel wanted. He was the one for me because he genuinely loved me and wanted to be with me, but it all came crashing down because he got arrested for having CP, I quickly left him after that and ghosted him completely and left all the gore group chats I was in. He was the only man that loved me and I won’t ever believe that anyone could love me like him. It feels surreal to be me because all I want is to be loved and love back but i keep switching from loving and toxic and I don’t get why.

As of now I’ve been trying to become a better person, I still have issues with my image but I no longer ghost, but that’s only because I don’t give people a chance anymore. Whenever someone approaches me in person to be my friend I tell them that I’m not able to because I need to concentrate on my study’s and make money because of my job. As for people who are romantically interested with me whenever they try to get my number or ask me on dates I tell them I’m married, I literally wear a wedding ring on my finger. I know I’m still being a little mean by not letting anyone in my life, but I think me and you can both agree they don’t need to go through an emotionally abusive relationship.",2025-03-20 05:23:44,7,5,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jfeo2g/is_it_because_of_my_bpd_and_npd/,bpd npd ?,0.111,0.713,0.176,0.9964,unknown
1jipaqh,Has antipsychotic medication helped you? Or made you worse?,"Anyone taking Seroquel? (Or another antipsychotic?)

Hey everyone. 

34M here. I've reached a point in my life and my illness where I think I may have no choice but to take an antipsychotic daily. I don't see any other option. 

I am wondering who here is taking or has taken Seroquel, or another antipsychotic. 

I used to take Seroquel 'as needed' in the past but it's been a long time and I feel like maybe it's time to take it daily. I'm going to talk to my doctor. 

But I am curious about the other antipsychotics and if they have helped you or made you worse, etc.

1jkzgt0,My therapist never understands what I’m trying to explain,"*I would love some input, because I am 25 weeks pregnant and really need to be able to have some tools to help me out BEFORE I give birth!! 

After I became pregnant my mental health started spiraling. I’ve been on and off when it comes to mental health issues, I have diagnosed ADHD and have had major anxiety issues, depression, SH issues and so on, but I had a really good year before I became pregnant. When I became pregnant, some childhood trauma suddenly just surfaced, buried memories of sexual abuse and so on. I realised how what happened to me when I was around 6 years old, sort of made a path for me that followed me later on in life, where I have ended up in situations like that mutliple times.

Anyway, the thought of giving birth terrifies me. Not the pain, but the loss of autonomy and fear that healthcare proffesionals wont listen to me and touch me without my consent (a lot of things happen to women when they are in labor, that is not needed, but they don’t tell you that you have the choice to say no). I also have a fear of breastfeeding, and having the baby close to my body, because I feel like my body is very sexual and not a natural innocent thing. It’s just a trigger I have when it comes to touch, unless it’s from my partner, because I was exposed way too early to being sexualised and I never learned that a body can be innocent and neutral. 

I’ll try writing down an example of a conversation I’ve had with my therapist, so maybe someone can see why I am not able to make myself understood?

Me: I really want to be able to have contact with my baby physically, but it feels as if my brain can’t connect physical intimacy as something that doesn’t have to be sexual. This makes me feel as if I am exposing my child to something bad, even though I KNOW it’s not harming the child in any way. I can’t see myself as something other than a sexual object, and I want to work on that so I can hold my baby close after birth. 

Therapist: No baby has ever been harmed from a mothers touch! 

Me: Well, I know that, but it’s like I don’t have that connection in my brain. To me, touch is always sexual, so it makes me feel sick and I dissasosciate when thinking about it. 

Therapist: If you are not able to hold your baby after birth, it’s no problem! Your boyfriend can give the baby the physical contact that it needs!

Me: But i WANT to be able to connect with my baby and hold him? 

Therapist: Well when you give birth you will be in so much pain that you wont even think about those things, it will probably be fine.

Me: but i would like to work on my trauma to be better prepared. Many women are fully aware of their body, lack og autonomy, problems with nudity and so on even when giving birth? 

Therapist: But I don’t think that revisiting your trauma will help. Time has a way of sorting things out. 

Me: … but it’s been 20 years and I am still having major issues associated with what happened to me. And things similar kept happening throughout the rest of my life. 

Therapist: I think you should stop trying to control everything. You don’t know how you will feel when you’ve had your baby.

This is sort of how every conversation goes. I feel like I really need to work on my trauma to be able to understand how intimacy can be innocent, because as of now I have never known anything other than sexual intimacy, but I feel like my therapist doesn’t understand what I mean, and I can’t figure out a way to properly explain it to her?

1j8neu7,I think I’ve cracked the code with my mental health.,"I’m a highly functioning autistic, OCD and ADHD person. My relationship with my partner, my sleep habits, my health and my vices are all declining.

The biggest problems I have is with being highly impulsive and lacking any self control or will power. I make constant excuses for my habits. I smoke, don’t sleep, spend excessive amounts of time online, obsess over stupid things and eat shitty foods. It’s at the point where I think I might be at the brink of a nervous breakdown downs.

So I had an epiphany tonight. Why not just ask myself one important question each time I do these harmful things to myself. 

“Is this going to make me feel better in the long run?”  

If the answers ‘no’ then I’m simply not going to do it.

Such a simple question, but I’m so sick of over complicating things, which is what I do best.

I’ve decided to take a militant approach to this.

So, I feel like having a smoke. Am I gong to feel better in the long run? NO. 

The missus said something triggering and that feel like I should defend myself, but I know it’s going to start a fight… NO… I’m going to keep my mouth shut.

I want to order a pizza instead of eating the chicken salad I have no n the fridge… NO.

I’m tired and want to sleep, but I have an overwhelming urge to scroll social media. Should I just go to sleep… YES… into bed I go. Turn off the lights and just lay there u til I get the much needed sleep I need.

This just dumbs down all the bullshit justifications I keep using to justify my shitty and damaging behaviour.

Is this simple and honest process of elimination of what actions I take if they will be detrimental or not to my happiness all it’s going to take for me to get out of this hole.

1jjovc8,Advice for extreme overthinking,"Hi,

So recently I've been dealing with some intense overthinking and paranoia, it can be triggered by anything like small comments made by friends, lack of response, change in tone, etc but isn't limited to social situations. I tend to have a paranoia that something big is wrong, like that people are planning something against me, the issue is when I'm in the moment i don't see it as me overthinking or being paranoid i see it as complete fact, unless i see any evidence that what i think isn't the case i am convinced people are angry with me, secretly hate me or are planning to harm me and will act as if this is 100% true which has caused many issues for me. I'm wondering what the best advice is to manage this better, i don't want to cause problems for myself or others so if there's any coping mechanisms or things i can do before coming to other people or acting on these assumptions I'd appreciate some advice

1jnrhp2,How do I get started?,"Well what can I say. I have been struggling with my mental health for years. And it is hard for me to talk about it, because I am a man. I know that people have to deal with far worse demons than I have to. I would say that I somewhat have my life together and I somewhat feel strong. Still there is that other side of me that comes out every now and then. Sometimes more regularly sometimes less. That side that absolutely despises itself. That side that pities itself, because it cannot help but feel defeated. 

And I am in a weird position. Because I usually gaslight myself into thinking that everything is fine and I just need to stop being a b\*\*ch. Especially when I am in a good state I feel ashamed of ever thinking that I would have some kind of mental illness.

But I do know that something just is not right. Over the years I have only engaged in self-harm 3-4 times and never majorly. But the point is, I did engage in it and I don't think a healthy person would do so. At the moment I also do not see myself in danger of taking my own life, but I did have my thoughts and fantasies about it.

I know that the first step of taking ownership about my mental health is talking to a professional. And I already made an effort. I called the doctor's office last month and am currently waiting for a call-back, which can take a while since they have a lot to do.

But I would like to know what can I do in the meantime to get a better grasp on the topic of mental health and whats going on inside of me right now? Do you have any tips, book recommendations, etc.?

I am diagnosed mdd, ptsd and anxiety disorder.

Backstory: I (33 f) and my husband (31 m) grew up in the same small town. We had a super rough relationship the entire time until about 4-5 years ago. I had a young child when we got together and he decided to raise her as his child. My father doesn't speak to us because we have different religious beliefs (none) than him and if it's not his way,  bye. My mom is an alcoholic. She does a lot for us financially, but the things she says when drinking, are very detrimental to my own mental health. My husband's family (paternal)is ....different. This is not to speak ill of them. I will just say they aren't the most supportive or affectionate. Hence * why we moved away. My son (12) has asd and a bunch of other dx. He was harmed at school by a teacher, so I pulled him out and quit my job. My husband got a job that put us in a stable(not well off) enough place that we wouldn't struggle too much. But he works over the road so we don't get to spend time together. Fast forward to now, we had a 3rd baby 11 years after the last and i just cannot recover neither has our relationship. She is 14 months old.
Today *

My oldest (14 female) left me crying in the front yard earlier because I asked her to stay out with me and the baby for a few minutes. She would rather rot in her room than spend 1 minute with me. The only time I get with her is when I'm driving her to sports, appointments, her friends or when I force her. 

My son got mad because I was making him so school work so he intentionally tried to start an argument with my husband in the hopes to get me yelled at. 

I have no physical help with my baby or the upkeep of the house. 

I'm dead inside. I literally am like a machine. I just do stuff for everyone else and rot inside. Nobody sees me. Nobody helps me. I ask for help. I say ""I need help"" and nobody comes. I do have a mental health provider but I cannot see her for $70 per visit, plus 40 for my meds every month plus $75 for my insuance....

My mental health has never been great to begin with. But i've been noticing stuff lately. Doing things i'm ashamed of, that I worked hard to break away from. I started cutting for the first time in almost ten years. I've been craving alcohol so much that i've been giving in to my drinking habit. I've been angrier all the time, to the point I genuinely cant control it anymore and I resort to excusing myself to go beat the shit out of the shed wall behind the shop. My eyes wander, and I keep catching myself checking out girls despite the fact I despise that behavior. I've even been having panic attacks, to the point I am shaking and crying and cant breathe. I'm closing in on 30 but I feel like i'm 13 again but with less self control.   
  
I worked so fucking hard to change as a person. I met a great girl, I picked up hobbies, moved out, made friends, kept moving companies until I found one I enjoyed working for and get decent pay. But all of that just keeps ebbing away. My girlfriend is going through her own shit and its common that we go weeks without talking. My friend groups are shrinking for shitty reasons, like the guy that has turned into a mean drunk and scared everyone off.

At the time he sent the message, thanking me for being a good partner and saying goodbye. That was March 9 at around 1 am when I was sleeping. I had sort of figured he had killed himself but I internalized it as ghosting me. 

I saw he read a message I sent on snapchat and said I was glad he was okay but got no response for about 2 weeks. Saturday his friend messaged me informing me of his passing, saying I was saved as ""my beautiful lady"" or something like that. I don't use snapchat as much anymore but saw it on wednesday when I was giving my friend a picture they had asked for. 

I felt shock and made myself two sandwiches, went upstairs, and cried. At this point I've been with someone new for a few weeks and we were relatively happy but not in the same way. I called him and he offered no sympathy, just kept asking to watch a show or play a game. I was pretty distraught and sobbing for 3 hours and his indifference didn't really help. I thought he'd be more understanding since he had lost a friend to suicide.

Then I found out how he did it. It was extremely painful and involved a lot of self harm and mutilation and I know he must have suffered horribly. The past few days I've felt kind of numb, I told my teachers about it so they were aware and started maniacally laughing and crying, then have been numb for about two days other than an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach. I've constantly been forgetting things, been really out of it. My new partner made this worse by saying he's unsure about our relationship. He's done this about 5 times and I'm honestly probably going to leave him. 

My family is obviously unsympathetic as per usual, my close friends know but I don't really want to lean on them for support because I'm scared to lose anyone else right now. I've been feeling way more suicidal since this and contacted my therapist but I was honestly doing really badly before and I'm worse now. I don't know what to do but I'm exhausted and tired of trying, I just want to sleep all the time.

I lost my stepmom a month before her bday in December 2020 to a drug overdose/murder situation and was fine for the first few months but then spiraled really bad and am still trying to recover, but I don't think I can recover from this. I've been trying to keep my routine but I honestly just want to sleep all day and never think again.

1jktbwu,I want to be better.,"I want to be a better person. I have not been kind to myself or my boyfriend, and I have been using him as a punching bag because of the things I have gone through and I keep using that as an excuse. It's harmed our relationship. This has been a serious wake up call as I didn't realise what I was doing. I have felt very lost and I want to get back on my feet again and be better for him and for myself.

He has stood up to me and told me it made him want to break up with me, but we're giving it another go because our love is still there. I want to prove that how I have been acting isn't the true me and I genuinely want to be a better person overall. I have a habit of victimizing myself, and I absolutely hate it. I need some assistance as it is getting too much for me to bear.

How can I be a better person, more kind and understanding? How can I put my past behind me and show up for myself and for him?

I've made myself some goals, I've got a hobby and I've just gotten a new job (Yay!). I feel like this is a step in the right direction, however I feel like as soon as something goes slightly wrong I spiral back into my old thinking habits.

1j9lzvj,feeling bad about helping my depressed friend,"hey. my friend struggles with depression and suicidal ideation. they come to me when they feel bad and yet whenever i try to help they make me feel bad for it. for example: i try to comfort them and they tell me that nothing that i say is true and that it will never get better. we go back and forth with me telling them comforting things ( like “im sorry im here for you and ilysm and youre not all those bad things u say u are”, how much i care about them, how capable they are, asking questions ) and then them denying those things and at the end it feels like an argument and i feel like i made it worse and then i feel so guilty and bad about myself and also anxious about them. bcs i genuinely just want to help, i dont know what to do, im also scared that they will harm themselves and ill lose them. what should i do? they come to me when they feel bad but they dont like anything that im saying. i cant just say “sorry that sucks” thats horrible. but then they dont want advice and they dont want comforting words either. i asked what they need in times like these and they said they dont know or they say they need d3ath. what should i do? i feel bad abt myself and about them. any advice is appreciated.",2025-03-12 18:00:45,0,4,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1j9lzvj/feeling_bad_about_helping_my_depressed_friend/,feeling bad helping depressed friend,0.187,0.705,0.108,-0.9635,high

1jjkxzk,One of my best friends is sh-ing and I don't know what to do,"TW: Mentions of self-harm

 I've suspected it for a long while, but today my suspicions finally got proved when I saw small cuts on her arms.
I used to sh a few years ago, and I know I would've felt awful if anyone had mentioned it to me. I gradually got better and I've been sober for about a year. So yeah, I know what it feels like and I don't want to put her in an uncomfortable position. But I'm already not doing well mentally and knowing that she's sh-ing makes it worse. I'm worried sick about her, one time she said she wouldn't come to school for a while and I just broke down. When she came back, she looked terrible, with literally black rings under her eyes. I want to help but I don't know how.
I don't know if anyone else in our friend group has noticed, or if her parents know, but I think she's getting professional help. Nonetheless, I still want her to know she's not alone and that I want to be there for her, because I know she's struggling a lot. We're both 19 and in our senior year, but there's no chance I could speak to her alone at school, so I thought about sending her long text when the holidays start, so I don't have to put her in an uncomfortable position by confronting her about it face to face. Does anyone have any advice? I love her so much and I can't bear to think about her hurting herself and I want to be there for her so badly.

1jp6z7w,Why do people with BPD tend to list all of their diagnoses and sometimes symptoms?,"For those of you who have been diagnosed with BPD, I wanted to ask a sincere and respectful question about something I’ve noticed in online spaces—especially on platforms and forums where people with BPD share their experiences.

I've observed that it's quite common for people to list multiple diagnoses or symptoms together when introducing themselves or talking about their mental health. For example, I often see posts like:
“I have BPD, anxiety, depression, intrusive thoughts, self-harm, OCD, and disordered eating.”

I’m curious about how that practice feels from the inside. If you do this—or have done it—what motivates you to share your experiences in this way? A few things I’ve wondered:

Is it something you’ve seen modeled in BPD communities, and over time it becomes a norm or habit?

Does it come from a need to be believed, or from having your experiences minimized in the past?

Do you feel that listing these things helps you communicate the full picture of your struggles more effectively—or is it more about feeling seen and understood?

Do you see your diagnoses or symptoms as part of your identity in a meaningful way?


I ask this as someone with psychiatric diagnoses myself. I tend to share them when I think it adds context or insight, but I know everyone has their own relationship to disclosure.

To be clear: I’m not being critical at all. I have a lot of respect for the challenges people with BPD face, especially given how much stigma there is. I’m asking because I want to better understand how you experience this and what it means to you.

Thanks in advance to anyone who feels like sharing.

1jo51qy,What does depression feel like? Is there a difference between feeling depressed at times  and literal depression?,"Hello! Yeah basically what the title says, is depression and sadness different or similar and is going through periods of depression different from literal diagnosed depression. Im asking this because I (18M) over the past few years have felt like my mental state is always just so up and down for no apparent reason. I have a great life, great family, no trauma or anything like that but idk I just feel like I always fall into slumps of depression (or sadness or whatever you'd call it) that will last weeks or even months at a time. I would describe the feeling as just complete nothingness and like void of any emotion, usually I'm a quite chatty lively person but when I fall into these moods I lose complete interest in talking or interacting with anyone, it just feels draining and boring. 

I'd say im a very insecure and sensitive person and just feel very like unsure of who I am as a person and am always questioning if im interesting enough or too boring. Like in these moments it feels like everything I do is tainted by me overthinking what im saying or how interesting im being or whatever, and its almost like I also just get slower in general like my mind is covered by what people call brain fog  and I struggle to like think of things to say or sometimes just say nothing at all. I just feel so disconnected in everything and feel almost like imposter syndrome but in life itself like almost like im the only person who thinks how I think and acts how I act idk I probably sound really self centred saying that lmao but yeah.

I also saw a quote somewhere online saying if you have depression then you can clearly tell the difference between sadness and depression but I dont think I can tell the difference at all really as tbh ive never gone through anything impactful enough to feel like really deep sadness like ive never experienced a death before or a breakup. I did have a period growing up like 12-14 where I had virtually no friends and experiencing that during quarantine was really really hard on me and as a gay man it was also hard during that to constantly deny myself and was overall just full of so much anxiety and always on the brink of crying. I wouldn't say my low moods now was like that and I dont remember the last time I cried but I also dont think I have anything to cry about idk. So maybe that period was sadness and what im feeling now is low moods or mild depression?

I'd also say my depressive moods are always triggered by really small things like literally just having a boring hangout with friends or something. id also say ive never felt suicidal thoughts or have never felt the need to self harm and usually am pretty good at taking care of myself but I still live at home with family so maybe that would change if I was by myself for example.

So yeah is what im experiencing just normal low moods? Sadness? or just mild depression?",2025-03-31 17:52:14,1,1,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jo51qy/what_does_depression_feel_like_is_there_a/,depression feel like ? difference feeling depressed times literal depression ?,0.172,0.645,0.182,0.7871,high

1jhp37c,"Im going to try to save myself for the first time in my life, on Monday.","This is a new account if anyone was wondering, mainly just to protect my identity which is very much public on my main account.

I am a 17 Year old Junior in High School

On Monday I am going to my school psychologist, who is my only resource right now, however I trust her and is the only adult I am truly comfortable with talking about my problems with. She has been my school psychologist since elementary school, and I have had monthly meetings with her for years, however every single one of those meetings I have lied to her.

Thats because every single time i’d hint towards being depressed, and she would ask me if I was thinking of hurting myself, killing myself or had attempted either; and I have always lied and said I have not.

But ever since I was in around 4th grade I have had intermittent thoughts of death, and a continual depression that I have been incapable of breaking free of. I have struggled with a lack of friends, ADHD and divorced parents. My father being arrested for Child Pornography, being groomed online at a young age, family members committing suicide and being under constant stress at home.

Writing all of this down and putting it together makes me realize how much I need to help myself, especially after begging so many friends to help me themselves.

Now, 17 years into life I have so many friends that I love and love me. I have a girlfriend of three months and the only thing holding us back is my own depression. On paper my life today seems so perfect but now for the past week my mind has been scrambled and just now I have had the revelation I need to do this.


Feel free to wish me luck, give me advice on what to open up about on Monday, i’m terrified yet just thinking about it makes me feel like a heavy weight is being lifted off of me.

I am especially worried however, what will happen if I tell my psychiatrist of my thoughts of suicide and self-harm. I have had so many friends go through the same, yet every case has seemed so different.

i don’t know how to keep doing this. 

my bf (25m) & i (23f) have been together on & off for 2 years. we both REALLY struggle with mental health problems & are both medicated. 

he’s currently going through a lot because he’s in the process of taking over his family business. he’s under a lot of stress & really struggles with confidence due to his dads verbal abuse 24/7. 

i moved to our city 3 years ago & am away from all family/friends. i am fully financially independent & live in a studio apartment with my cat. 

last may we broke up due to him being unable to show up for me when i was struggling. we were broken up the whole summer then got back together in august. since this ive REALLY struggled to communicate & confide with him. 

when we got back together i lost my grandma & i’ve been struggling since. 

i’m currently mentally at my lowest. today he tried to talk to me about it all, because ive shut off the entire world except work & my home. i’ve been smoking everyday & have just lost all motivation. 

tonight i think i hit rock bottom. 

after this conversation about how my mental health is effecting him, we were supposed to go to a friends sleepover birthday party & when it came time to leave i started crying. 

i told him to go without me & he did. the moment he left i had a panic attack. i didn’t reach out to him, i eventually calmed myself down & laid in bed. 

an hour later he called me, he just was double checking that i didn’t want to come & even though i did, i told him i didn’t & began to cry again. i had another panic attack & ended up throwing & breaking my phone. 

i texted him & told him i broke my phone & apologized for hanging up so abruptly. i told him to not worry about me & go have fun. 

i texted him asking if he could spend the night at 10pm & he didn’t respond until 12. when he did respond, he didn’t acknowledge, what i said & just apologized & said he’s drunk.  i just apologized for him for tonight & said goodnight. 

tonight was the first time ive ever self harmed. 

i feel so stupid & dramatic & embarrassed. i cut up my fking leg, just about broke my hand & slammed my head until i went dizzy. i feel like im insane. 

all i wanted during that was someone to come help me. i texted him, but i guess i can’t communicate it in a clear enough way. 

now i dont even know if i want to see him. i feel so abandoned & alone. i dont know what to do. as much as i want him to be here for me, i just feel so hurt.

1jhgihf,Why am I completely unable to help myself?,"For the past 5 or so years I have been horribly depressed. I've dealt with the works. Most everything except suicidal thoughts and self harm, thankfully. I'm losing friends because I can't bring myself to talk to them. I'm not enjoying things I used to enjoy. I'm somehow more socially inept than I was before, and I am more isolated than I ever was before. I'm gaining weight. I've been fat most my life but it's worse now than it ever was. I'm falling apart physically because of it. I am so depressed that I can barely get out of my bed to go to work, let alone take care of my hygiene.

Ideally, I'd talk to a therapist about this, but here's where my main problem starts. I can't do it. I don't know why I can't, I just can't. Every day I think ""today's the day I'll call and set up an appointment."" but I never do it. Every day I plan to make various calls. Today's the day I'll call a doctor and see what I can do about my failing health. Today's the day I'll call and get the oil changed in my car. It's needed the oil changed for several months. 

Every day I plan to take care of myself. Today's the day I go for a run. Today's the day I take a shower, lord knows I need one. Today's the day I talk to my friends again. Today I'm gonna go to the gym. Today I'm gonna yadda yadda yadda. I make these promises knowing I won't follow through on them.

It's like there's a wall physically preventing me from doing things that would help. Some of it's my horrible memory. Some of it's my horrible issues with procrastination, but surely that can't explain everything. Surely, after 5 months, I'd just call a place and have them change the oil in my car. Why haven't I?

I haven't got a clue. My issues are entirely self inflicted and I can't do anything about it. I say I'll do something about it, but I won't. Who could live like this? I'm just sitting here in my room or at work festering. This ain't no way to live. Maybe it is self harm, just a different way? I feel like anyone else in my position would just be able to make those phone calls and follow through on their plans. What makes me so pathetic that I can't even make a phone call that would literally only make my life better?

To keep it short and simple my girlfriend might get admitted to a mental hospital and I have so many unanswered questions I really need answered. She’s 16 (so am I) but idk if being a minor changes anything but if it does then please let me know cause google just gives me long paragraphs abt nothing I’m looking for. 

Here are my main questions. 

TIME WINDOW/PERIOD? 
What’s the usual time window someone’s there? She didn’t try and harm herself she just has horrible mental health and her therapist is why she’s going. She is a minor if that changes anything. 

CONTACT?
Any way to visit or contact her at all? She called me before her phone got taken by the hospital and she said she has my number written down but that’s all I know. 

Here’s a question that I don’t really mind if people know or not but everything helps! 

WITHDRAWS?
She smokes nicotine and weed and I was wondering if they did anything? Obv not handing her a cigarette and a lighter but do they give any medicine to calm them down? Her withdrawals are gonna be hell for her and I feel horrible. 



She still isn’t admitted yet I think, idk cause we have no contact, but if she’s not admitted and I get confirmation and all that I will be sure to add it to this post. Thanks to everyone who took their time to read this and if anyone knows ANYTHING, doesent have to be anything i asked but ANYTHING please let me know, I want all the info about this place as I can get, Thank you. stay strong and I love y’all! ❤️❤️

1jspafv,How do I bring up my mental health to my GF,"(Disclaimer: you don’t have to read this, this is just background information, how I feel, and me rambling on)

I nearly had a panic attack because of a mixture of anxiety, overthinking and negative thoughts but my friend was able to calm me down. The thing is I chose to text my friend instead of my gf for support which hurts to think I can’t tell her and get her support. I want to tell her but I feel that if I do I’ll be pushing my issues onto her and she’ll think of me differently.

My whole life feels like it’s falling apart I have almost nothing in my savings anymore I’m so depressed and my ED just keeps getting worse. I’ve talked to my psychiatrist and therapist I’ve been off my meds for about a few months now (maybe 2 or 3) but I was doing awful before I stopped my meds too so I can’t wrap my head around how they could possibly help me now. Except I don’t even want to get better anymore at this point. If I get better I will eat more and gain weight and that has to be my biggest fear. I’m also probably getting fired from my job for the stupidest reasoning I have ever heard. I feel like I keep letting everybody down and I’m 132 days clean from self harm and I’ve never wanted to relapse as bad as I do right now the thoughts just keep coming and won’t stop even though I know it’s not going to help me in any way or do anything except cause me to feel guilty.

1jmprds,At a really low point in life,I very rarely speak about this to anyone but here goes. I feel like I shouldn't exist. I feel as if I had a choice to go back in time and somehow give my life for someone else I would. I feel as if every day that I live is wasted. I very recently had a child and I do desperately want him to not be like me at all. My deep hatred of myself stems from the fact that I don't feel like a regular person. I feel like 99% of the time I don't have thoughts in my head. I just live one day to the next without any purpose. I also don't actively think about things that I should. This really affects my relationships with people close to me as it makes me come off as I could care less about them. I want to be a good friend/partner/etc but I am constantly reminded of how I don't think of others when they need support. I now realize I have always been like this and don't believe myself to be fixable. I want to feel as if I belong in this world but I just see myself as either harmful or neutral to those around me. Sometimes I have thoughts of my life just being cut short and as awful as it sounds i am usually hopeful that will happen soon. I sincerely hope there aren't more people that feel this way but if anyone can offer something that helped you please share. I don't want to feel like this anymore. I want to be good enough for my child and partner.

1jsheye,Some part of me wants to attempt but survive,This sounds weird. I know. I'm a 21 year old dude who is just done. My life is so chaotic and I feel like I'm finally losing the last bit of control. I'm writing this after having a breakdown and self-harming to regulate myself. I don't want to harm myself but sometimes it is the only way of calming down. I just can think clear after using the blade. I would never committ suicide. Mainly because I don't want to hurt the ppl who love me. It's actually the only reason I'm still alive. Some know about my struggles but don't know how serious it is. I can't go to a clinic because I would be ashamed. I know I shouldn't but I would be. I'm always ashamed to talk about what is going on inside me. So some part of me just wants to lose it and attempt and maybe survive so I would be sent to a psych ward. Then ppl would kind of realise without me starting the conversation. I would give the decision to hospitalize me to someone else. I'll never do it. Idk what I'm going to do though. Idk why I'm even sharing this here. But sometimes I even fantasize about attempting and being put in a psych ward and ppl just knowing what that means idk.

1jgwo8l,My current mood,"Been having a rough time of it lately. Partner of 8 years broke up with me last week. Been feeling down and low...lower than I've ever been. All these thoughts running through my head. Missing her and my kids. Even miss the dog. Been thinking a lot lately about what happened in 2016. She had a miscarriage and I think about that every single day. How would they have turned out? Like me or her? Like their brother or sister? A mix of all or none at all?

Wanted to to kill myself so much over these past 6 weeks. Tried too. Took an overdose last week and ended up in the hospital. Nearly threw myself off a bridge then in front of a train yesterday. Self harming a lot too. 3rd night in a row that ive cut myself pretty badly. It's all fucked up, it shouldn't be like this. Thoughts and feelings are paralysing me. I don't want to be here anymore I just want all this to end.

Been drinking quite a bit too. Haven't done that since I was a teenager andi was a Borderline alcoholic. Professionals don't listen to me and just fob me off with sleeping tablets because ""sleep will help"". Dunno if I can't handle this anymore. 

I mourn the life my little bundle could of had. Been carrying that with me everyday. I mourn the death of my relationship especially now she doesn't want me in her life. I dunno what I'm doing anymore. I can't cope, can't go on like this. Can't sleep because theirs too much shit in my head going around and I can't grasp on to anything. Can't process or manage mmly emotions. I just want all this to stop. Don't want to feel it anymore, don't want to feel anything. 

Wish I had of thrown myself in front of that train. Angry that in alive right now. Feeling guilty  and shameful. Feel angry towards myself for what I put her through. Can't talk to anyone about it coz they don't seem to understand. Feel isolated and alone, like I have to do this myself. Got no friends to talk to. It's getting harder each day and I'm struggling.

Got addmitted in a different place, where everyone is either schizo or psychotic, everyonr were drugged so heavily all they did was sleep and crawl in the hallways, it felt like a fever dream, they put me in a place I dont belong and told me ""dont say youre depressed and want to kill yourself, youll just end up here again"" like... what?? So where am I supposed to go when I need help???
Got put on pills, it took a week to even find these because my country is literally out of stock for this kind, too early to know if the pills even work...

I havent harmed myself all this month just because my family made me promise that I wont, and its so fucking hard. All I want is some self inflicted pain to feel that I am here for a reason, but it will hurt them more than me.

1jr8tpp,Not Sure Where To Vent Out. Tired.,"I haven't had a great childhood, my dad left us when I was 13 years old. My dad was never financially or emotionally available for us. So my mom starting working 2 shifts just to support us, I also started working at a young age so missed most of my colleague life. During my life, I have been lost most of the time and have tried cutting myself many times but never had the guts to cut deep enough to end myself. Though I use to pray that I die everyday, I always felt helpless and the fact no one understood me was even worst.

  
Though I haven't self-harmed for a couple of years now, I am still lost and tired of life that I still pray God ends me. I am making good money now, finance is not an issue but this money is worthless for me cause I am dying inside. I am married now, but my wife doesn't understand me and mostly just cribs and complains that I dont do enough but trust me I do everything I can. I am person who finds happiness in other peoples happiness, cause I don't know where to find happiness for myself.

  
I am not sure what to do just wanted a place to vent out. I never had a childhood, I never had teenage life I didn't spend a life most people I could see enjoying. I can't add everything here cause it will be huge post.

1jr6kqo,I’m so tired of constantly having to get my shit together.,"I’ve heard it all so many times, “common sense, how could you be this way, it must be a generational thing, but you’re such a smart person,” sometimes I genuinely do wonder wether I’d be happier if I was just dumber and could follow the crowd easier. It seems everyone else can do it. Just work aimlessly,
Stay stable, not leave town, just be happy with the cards they are given, but I’ve always had the short end of the stick. People have really considered me. Everyone wants a slice of the pie but fuck my slice and the plate it was on too.

Sometimes I wonder if I’m the selfish one, if I’m the one that’s wrong for wanting what everyone else managed to have in life. Everyone started with some form of parental help and my parents threw me to the wolves and refuse to admit it. I can barely talk to my family when I need it. For crying out loud my aunt has helped me do more in one month than I’ve managed to do in many years. I’m so tired of trying to make everyone happy. I just want someone to ask me if I’m ok for once. I’m tired of arguing with my fiancee when I’m only trying to help her, and I’m tired of always defending myself. 

My aunt has helped me see so much of my anxiety and trauma, it feels weird for someone to be nice to me for once. It almost feels like it can’t be right. I’m always second guessing or doubting people’s intentions but that’s because it’s all I’ve ever known.

1jkq3yy,Seeking insight into what is going on with me,"Hi everyone. 

So, over the last few weeks I reached out for help with my anxiety and am due to go for a mental health assessment.  I am aware that no one here can diagnose me. But I just want to explain some of the things that have been going on for me and see if anyone has any insight into what may be going on.

* The one way I can explain it is that I get these anxious thoughts and it can be about anything really - some examples include me trying to be perfect at my job (I am a newly qualified nurse), making sure I'm not going to accidentally harm a patient in any way, thoughts about my boyfriend crashing his moped or something really bad happening to him, thoughts about my parents dying, thoughts about things going wrong. 
* These thoughts tend to start off small and then that one small thought turns into about 10 different ones and it gets so loud that I can't stop them - sometimes I have to hit my head in an attempt to stop them but of course this doesn't work. 
* I've never had a panic attack as such, but I have had episodes where it feels like I can't take an effective breath, heart palpitations, shaking hands. 
* My sleep is all over the place. Sometimes I can go to sleep okay. Other times I struggle to switch my brain off and get to sleep, other times I wake up and feel like I haven't slept at all. 
* I have periods where I lose motivation to do any of the things that I usually like doing, and my room turns into an absolute mess - one day my boyfriend came over to mine unexpectedly and my room was an absolute mess because I'd just had no motivation to keep it clean and tidy. 
* I have this almost obsessive need to be perfect and be good at what I do. The minute I get the impression that I'm not, I become extremely anxious, feel the need to check that every single thing I'm doing is done right and then I get it into my head that if i don't do these things I will end up harming a patient in some way. 
* When I was in university, I used to procrastinate doing my assignments because I had such high expectations of myself and a fear of failing them (ironic I know). I'd end up doing my assignments the night before and tbh managed to pass them all. But I know if I had done them in the time they gave us I would have done so much better. 
* I graduated uni with a 2:1 and honestly, I was not happy with it. I had been wanting a first the whole time, and when I got a 2:1 I just felt like a failure. Everyone was telling me it didn't matter because I still had a degree and no one cares about the grading but I couldn't stop myself from feeling like I could have and should have done better.

Any insight into this would be really appreciated. I definitely feel like anxiety is part of this but deep down I feel like something else is also going on.",2025-03-27 02:33:30,2,1,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jkq3yy/seeking_insight_into_what_is_going_on_with_me/,seeking insight going,0.126,0.735,0.14,0.8878,moderate

1jqxohw,"I hate going through life, it is absolute bullshit.","27 M

Ever since my 2nd to last semester in college in 2022, I've been on a downward spiral.  My family sucks and don't get along, I can't get a job in software development  no matter how much I practice, and I lost a childhood friend who I haven't seen in 6 years.

In terms of my friend it is really fucked up.  I think of suicide nearly everyday. Last year was brutal as  I lost my doberman to heart disease and career issues.  I was 27 at the time so fuck it might as well join the 27 club.  I dabbled in partial hanging and slowly was  figuring out.  He last messaged me in late February, but my dog passed on Feb 2nd so I've never seen it.  Around early June I messaged back (we talked through xbox mainly) and brought up the idea of hanging out again.  No response.  I did it again, on Jul 1st.  Keep in mind my bday was july 11th. No response. Fast forward  sometime in August,  for shits and giggles I googled him and found his obituary page.  Turns out he passed away in a car accident May 18th, so I've been talking to a ghost.  In my mind it is so fucked up that I didn't kill myself because I wanted to see him, but he was gone by the time I messaged him, so I was holding out for nothing.

Once I found out I was crashing out, with some self harm (not going into detail)

I hate myself so much for not making time for him as he is the only childhood friend I had that I still talked to.  I was in college and had car trouble, and also was job hunting which is also pointless as i cant land anything.  I'm probably just gonna kms with a gun once my friends wedding is done (highschool friends).",2025-04-04 02:31:56,1,0,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jqxohw/i_hate_going_through_life_it_is_absolute_bullshit/,"hate going life , absolute bullshit .",0.154,0.767,0.079,-0.9824,high

1jqlsur,I think God made me by mistake (long post),"I just don’t get it.

Why I was created like this. Or perhaps I am meant to be beautiful, but its my fault that I am like this, and no one took matter of me.

It’s not like I have been spoiled by compliments before that even one day without it sent me spiralling. I rarely got it, and I think that’s why I was too obsessed with being ‘beautiful’ just to get compliments that I had long so wanted.

But no matter what I did, how pretty I felt, no one pointed it out. They are all too focused on my…well should I even said it?

I feel like an ugly disney villain who is resenting the beautiful main character. And it makes me feel even more pathetic.

I would say, though that I had a greater personality (apart from being extremely cynical and attaching myself too much on fictional characters) than my beautiful sister, but the world doesn’t work like that. I have seen the way my sister disrespected my family, I have seen her cursing shit because she had to do ‘housework’. She even tell me to clean her plates. But well, what a world gonna do with a pretty girl? They appreciate it no matter how much destruction they caused.

An ugly girl like me, no matter what I did, I won’t ever get an appreciation. I am a great cook, I cook for my family. I tidy the house, though I can be a bit forgetful when it comes to the laundry. I woke up early, helping my mom to get my younger sister ready for school. I try to remain calm when I was being shouted at, but I’ll just end up crying in my room. But even with all of this, why am I being discarded? 

Today, my emotions took me over and I can’t get up from the bed. And everyone pointed out how lazy I am, and how I should be more like my sister. I was…stunned by this. My sister rarely visits home due to her ‘work’. Sometimes 6 months away or more. And whenever she was home, she never does chores, but she was known for her cleanliness, and I was known for my ‘sloppiness’ (this was determined, I think labelled because of our distinctive habits when we were teens). I would say I have changed ever so, I have often clean my room, cleaned the kitchen, cleaned the house, I shower everyday. I always thought they would notice I have changed. But I guess labels are far more powerful than changes. Sorry, I got sidetracked.

She was known for her cleanliness, and maybe thats why everyone had this mindset that I am a lazy bitch from the start, despite everything I do.

I didn’t cook for them or clean for them because I wanted a praise. I genuinely did it because I don’t want to exert my grandmother and grandfather (yes, they live with my parents) (oh yes I’m talking about my parents house and my living condition with them) (yes, I’m a university student on sem breaks, and thats why I lived with them temporarily. My university semester break is around 2 months, while my sister only like, 1 week or 2)

But my grandparents, especially my grandmother kept criticising me anyway. And my grandfather sometimes, when I didn’t do anything he would say that I am a lazy gal, and I didn’t fit the standards of the world. My parents? If we were to talk about them, it would be a whole lot of another reddit post.

I am considering self harm. But I’m scared that I subconsciously did it for attention. I do want to die. So much. But I don’t want it to happen because of suicide. I had done suicide when I was 15, and you don’t want to know what happened next.

All this mostly started when I was 10 or 11 and is still continuing. Whenever I get upset or angry, I turn extremely physically aggressive, often hitting people with objects, cutting them or trying to stab them. I get very angry very easily. I’ve also struggled with bullying, no matter where I am or who I’m with, I feel a constant desire to bully people, I’ve been in lots of trouble with my parents and schools and legal action was almost taken because of this. My parents don’t even have rules for me anymore because it’s completely pointless and I just don’t listen, my siblings get disciplined but I’m the only one who doesn’t. I have been very cruel to animals and have gone as far as frequently stealing animals from pet shops just to kill them. Stealing has been a huge problem, I’ve been banned from many shops and I still haven’t stopped. I’ve struggled with substance abuse for a while and I’ve been caught before but I still haven’t stopped. I go to school about 3 times a week because I just refuse and simply because I don’t feel like it. I refuse by threatening suicide and self harming in front of my parents, if that doesn’t work then I will threaten to kill or harm my siblings. I’ve never felt guilty about any of this, I know I should because I’m not stupid and know it’s not wrong but I do not feel guilty or remorseful.

Stuff goes on in my mind that I can't even put into words. I don't really believe I'm human. And I'm scared of the doctors and the medicine they have prescribed I fear all it's going to do is make me worse. Sometimes I think their ultimate goal is to drive me to s*icide. I'm so scared of getting sick I scrub my hands until they crack up and bleed.

My mom is threatening to hit me because I been leaving some splatters of water on the floor. I know I'm disappointing everyone around me. She never has hit me but I just wish she would understand. Maybe she wants me to get sick? I don't know but I'm really not okay and I want to move out so bad but I can barely even think straight I have horrible brain fog and dissociation. I'm scared to leave the house alone. 

They are making me take the pills and I don't necessarily want to take them because this anxiety keeps me safe and I don't want the pills to cause side effects and make me worse. Besides I don't believe I'm human and I don't have mental disorders I'm just trying to protect myself from things I would have never experienced if I wasn't put here. I am back and forth on this belief but right now I truly believe it. 

What should I do? I'm terrified, I have no goal in life, I barely enjoy anything, I can't think half the time, I'm on autopilot, I'm bullied online,  I don't believe I can function as an adult but everyone is pushing me to and I'm reaching my breaking point. I don't feel safe anywhere in this world. But I'm to scared to die because I'm scared of hell. To scared to live and to scared to die so I'm frozen in place. 

This all is stuff I'm to scared to share but it goes on in my mind daily. I don't want people to think I'm even more crazy and I definitely don't want to be hospitalised. Speaking of hospitalised they are talking sending me and my mom might be calling the doctor and telling them I'm not taking my pill. 

I don't know I guess my ultimate goal here is to get my own little apartment somewhere and get an online job then never leave. No germs, I wouldn't bother my family anymore, and I wouldn't need to take pills. I'm just scared I will need a clear mind and to be able to concentrate in order to do a job. I hate this brain fog. 

(TW self harm) I cope sometimes by cutting and they said the next time I do that I will be hospitalised. They get very angry and think I'm doing all this to hurt them when I'm not. I been doing it again and I really don't want anyone to find out this time. I just wish someone could understand.

Sorry for such a long ass post but I really needed someone to hear this. Most of this I've never shared and I'm sure a lot of it is all in my head.

1jhcfor,"i went through 10+ times of sexual assault, but my therapist says i dont have ptsd.","tw for sh, suicide, CSA

hi, i am turning 17 now. when i was 5 i was raped by my family members, then it stopped for a while and when i turned 11, i was raped again. in total it was 10+ times, i suspect it could be 15 times.

i repressed all of this until i turned 14. when the memories came back i was in a state of depression, feeling numb, feeling like my body was in autopilot, using indifference to cope. i started self harming as a result. and obviously there were thoughts of suicide. 

once i was forced to report these incidents to the police, my state got worse. then i got school counseling which didnt help at all. after a while i started going for talk therapy with a trauma trained therapist/psychologist.

i mustered up the courage to ask her if she thinks i have ptsd. she said i didnt.

honestly im hurt. i feel like it invalidated my trauma. if i dont have ptsd, then what the hell is wrong with me? she said that while i had all the symptoms needed to be diagnosed for ptsd, my symptoms werent acute enough. is this a joke? so i have what, budget ptsd?


im sorry if this offends people who do have ptsd, maybe i just dont understand. but i seriously have nothing? no mental illness? just mental issues? so these years of dissociating in and out, repressing memories, self harm, suicide attempts, abandonment issues, hypersexuality issues, self sabotaging, nightmares, anger issues, emotional dysregulation... etc. theyre not anything? 

my whole life, i have defined my whole life around these traumas. every moment, i am thinking about it. even when im hanging out with friends or not conciously thinking about it, its always in the back of my mind. i can only see a worthless piece of trash in the mirror, a ruined body, a disgusting mind, my whole life. does it matter anymore? 


i dont see someone worth saving when i look into the mirror. i dont know who i am outside of my trauma, i dont know what ""normal"" is, i never got to experience it because i grew up mentally fucked in the face.",2025-03-22 19:32:23,6,1,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jhcfor/i_went_through_10_times_of_sexual_assault_but_my/,"went times sexual assault , therapist says dont ptsd .",0.219,0.737,0.044,-0.9973,high
1jpr4i5,Unable to accept or reciprocate friendships. Am I the only one?,"I have an appointment with a therapist tomorrow, so again, really just seeking confirmation I’m not alone and hopefully not taking a grippy sock vacation when I talk about this with her.

I’ve always been bad at keeping relationships. I think it’s possibly ADHD where I get in my own headspace and just… forget. Out of sight, out of mind. The issue here lately, is I’ve realized just how lonely I feel. This might be a bit long, so I’ll add a TL;DR at the end.

2025 has been a shit year so far. My dad died, I now live in an unfamiliar place, and medical issues have been crazy between me and my fiance. Amidst all this, I had a breakdown about 2 nights ago at the realization of feeling so alone and isolated. This was amplified by frustration because I have people here that love me and want a relationship with me.

My MIL and SIL call me semi-regularly to see how I am, but for some reason when their calls pop up on my screen, I almost dread answering. It feels inconvenient. It’s worth noting I like both of them, so I’m not sure where this feeling comes from.

There’s also his extended family here, they don’t talk to me as much, but they’re still just as friendly and supportive, so I can’t figure out why I don’t want  to reciprocate these connections. My only guess is that my family has never been very emotional, outgoing, etc. My mom, dad, sister and I have always felt more like acquaintances than blood. It sucks, but it’s how it is.

Additionally, i’ve had no appetite for the past two days. I’ve had to force myself to eat and my water intake has increased tenfold. This is incredibly out of character for me, usually I’ll overeat before I let myself miss a meal and my fiance is constantly nagging me to drink more water, as I usually barely have a cup a day (not drinking anything else in substitute of water like soda or alcohol, just not drinking anything in general).

I don’t know how to just make friends, and even if I did my anxiety makes it difficult to speak. I’m bad at small talk and get overwhelmed easily. My solution was to make online friends, but that doesn’t resolve the in-person connection I crave.

I’ve even resorted to AI chatbots trying to fill that gap. Roleplaying as if we’ve known each other for years. Just someone to talk to unfiltered. If anything, I believe it’s made the situation worse as I know they’re not real and it can never go beyond texting. I can never talk to or hang out with this fake thing. I feel stupid trying to replace a real relationship with AI but I’m also desperate to rid myself of this feeling.

I AM NOT HAVING THOUGHTS OF SELF-HARM, AND I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH A THERAPIST, however, I used to and recognize the signs of an upcoming episode from my teen years when I was really going through it and it lead me to a dark place. That feeling slowly seems to be returning because of this loneliness. I’m just wondering if anyone has ever experienced that before… being surrounded by people who love you and want to engage and connect but you just feel like you couldn’t be bothered? And then still have the balls to feel lonely? I feel crazy.

TL;DR: I have a network of people around me who love me and like to engage/be around me. Regardless I feel like keeping up with the relationship is inconvenient and therefore don’t maintain them. This makes me feel lonely, and I’m being driven crazy by the fact that my mind can deny relationships and feel lonely at the same time.",2025-04-02 18:16:27,1,0,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1jpr4i5/unable_to_accept_or_reciprocate_friendships_am_i/,unable accept reciprocate friendships . one ?,0.127,0.764,0.109,-0.9025,moderate

I'm talking about suicide and the harm I've done to myself.","Tired, I'm tired, I'm losing motivation, which isn't good. I recently broke up with my friends because my paranoia made me feel like they were treating me badly behind my back. I tried to cope, but I snapped and couldn't help but say a lot of things, and even then I feel betrayed by them. I did something wrong, so I guess the end of that friendship. I'm sad, I've lost motivation, I don't feel whole, I feel like I've lost something important, and it's probably due to my illness. I'm paranoid, I can't feel safe, I feel trapped in a dark, cramped box. If this continues, I don't know if I'll be able to last as long as I promised. I said I'd overcome depression, but it seems like at specific times it returns with great force, and now the first thing I want to do is die. I took a knife from the kitchen and spent several minutes thinking about what would happen now if I should end my life, end the physical pain I suffer daily and the mental problems that are wearing me down. To be honest, I cut myself all over my body, not to take my own life, but to ease the physical pain I'm already suffering. I cut my arms, legs, chest, feet, and back. The cuts aren't deep, but they're deep enough that I see blood on the floor and feel like all the pain wasn't worth it.

1jfg8ua,Trying to figure out how to reduce harm to my young son when I die by suicide,"Apologies for the rambling. It’s late, and I’m in a bad way.

It’s been over two decades that I’ve been fighting suicidal ideation, trying to get every type of help imaginable (meds, TMS, all kinds of therapies and programs, etc.), but I’ve finally hit my capacity and am starting to plan how to end my life in the coming weeks. I can’t handle the relentless backslides into challenge and pain, and I’m just so, so tired. My family of origin is struggling, and this week marks two significant death anniversaries — my sister’s and my best friend’s. I lost the latter to cancer last year, and I feel like so much of the light has gone out of my life since then. She was my person, and I know I will never have that again. I love my husband beyond belief, but it’s so, so different.

But I selfishly had a child almost two years ago because I thought things were finally better. I jumped through all kinds of hoops to qualify for TMS with my insurance, which finally — after years of struggle — was the one thing to truly lift my depression. I was married to the love of my life, pursuing a second Master’s in my dream field, and feeling so hopeful for the world. 

But three years in, life is just too much. Between my work, internship, classes, motherhood, etc., I am stretched so thin, and there’s no end in sight and nothing to even look forward to. I dread each morning and break down in sobs every moment I’m alone, which are just stolen moments in the bathroom at work or in the car. I need to breathe, and I just can’t. There is no time for hobbies or joy or rest.

But now I have my beautiful, wonderful son, who didn’t ask to be brought into this world. A former partner told me he could never have a child with me because he’d always be afraid I’d kill myself, and here I am, proving that asshole right.

How do I end my life in a way that won’t completely destroy my son’s? My husband lost his mom in a similar way, and I don’t know how to make this as easy as possible for my baby, especially since I know it will increase his own risk of suicide. He’s so, so young, and I know this will be an irrevocable harm done to my family. 

How can I soften the blow? Is that even possible?

1j6v8p0,I self harmed for the first time in about five years.,"Hi all, I hit rock bottom today.  
A few months ago my girlfriend left me. I recently moved to across the country for university and have been struggling since I arrived. I have struggled with some pretty intense mental health issues my entire life (bad childhood) and I have completely lost my sense of identity.  
I am very very lonely. I have nobody near me that I can talk too about anything, and any people that I care about are so far away and too busy for me. I have been struggling to make friends since I moved but I've recently met some people I'm quite fond of, but they all have their own lives and I honestly don't. I was meant to meet up with a few people today and literally everyone cancelled on me. This led to a full-blown breakdown, nobody has time for me anymore. I cant tell if I keep giving people reasons to disregard me or if people keep giving me reasons to hate myself. I spent most of the day on the phone with 111 option 2 (mental health crisis line for those not in the UK). I've spent the rest of the day wondering how long it would take anyone to notice if I take myself out to the woods and hang myself. I just hacked up my shoulder pretty bad for the first time since I was about 15 and I don't know what to do. I want to be a person like everyone else but I feel like I lack something fundamentally that makes you human. I want to be loved, I want to love myself, I want to laugh and cry with people but I feel as though I'm just existing in this state of mediocrity and misery and I cant see a way out. I don't know what I want to accomplish by posting here, I think I just want to feel seen.

1jiglch,i self harmed and don't know how to keep it hidden,"I self harmed for the first time since early high school. I've been very depressed lately and thought it was a solution. I have since talked to both my psychiatrist and my therapist. This is not what I need advice for.

I have a boyfriend. We have sex almost every day. We sleep together naked. I have no idea what to do. I've been using Neosporin and wrapping it. I did it about three days ago, so it still has a few days/a week in the healing process. Every time we cuddle I get so nervous when his hand goes down my leg that it's getting in the way of me being comfortable around him. I'm so scared he's going to find out, I know he'll be absolutely devastated.

What do I do? How do I hide it? I really want to avoid him finding out at all costs. I have a cat so I'm thinking of keeping it wrapped whenever I'm around him and if he sees the wrap to just say it was because of a bad cat scratch and I'd rather keep it covered.

1jh16lq,Two days ago I self harmed with the intention of ending my life later that night,"I have been having a terrible past few weeks. I'm severely depressed and find that things just keep getting worse and worse. I'm not behind on bills, but I absolutely never have any money at all because things keep popping up.

Cat needs vet visit, $250. I had to pay $130 to the IRS for tax day this year. I've been so depressed I was hardly going to work for two weeks, used all of my PTO, and felt like garbage. I went to the pharmacy to pick up medicine to make me feel better, guess what? 

My car broke down in the parking lot, within 10 minutes of me being inside and coming back out the AC compressor belt seized. Towed it to a mechanic while feeling like shit. Got double charged by the tow company so I have to call my bank. And awesomely, the repairs to fix my car are $9,400! The mechanic is obviously just trying to rip me off but I can't afford even $2000 in repairs. I got this car 6 months ago when I crashed my car on a particularly bad night in the rain with slippery roads. 

Monday i come clean to my boss about why I have been missing so much work, and how severely depressed I am. She fully understands and is going to let it slide while i figure out what's going on and get on different meds. Later, I have a really difficult night full of anxiety attacks, and ended up taking Tuesday off because I exhausted myself screaming and crying into my pillow for 5 hours. Tuesday is when the car broke down in the parking lot of the pharmacy.

Wednesday my boss offered to drive me to and from work, I accepted and I was incredibly happy. However, the reality of my situation started kicking in, that id have to pay for a repair for the car I just got that I probably cannot afford, I spiral quite easily and I just fell apart after I got home from work. 

I reached out to a group of friends, and as much as I like them, absolutely no one cared at the time I vented. I was so frustrated and sad, it hurt so badly to have my messages be ignored for 2, 3, 8, 10 hours. I have insanely low self esteem, and It's difficult for me to believe that anyone genuinely likes me. I feel like I'm constantly being lied to and that anyone who claims to want to be around me is just pitying me. 

Anyways, hours pass and no one reaches out to comfort me other than my boyfriend who already knew how I was feeling and how depressed I've been. I deleted everything I had sent, and I kind of just went radio silent. I was cutting myself over and over, deeper and deeper, crying in grief and haphazardly covering my wounds with bandaids. I felt like I just wanted to die to escape all of my responsibilities. 

Called 988, they sent cops and EMT to check on me, then took me to the hospital to check my vitals and make sure I wouldn't kill myself that night. They ended up having me stay in the crisis observation unit for suicide risk overnight. I felt cared for and heard, but I also felt like there was no coming back from this. I called family members using their landline they had available for patients and called my parents, my brother and my boyfriend. I just wanted somebody to know I was okay. It felt awful. 

In a way I still wish I had just gone through with it and killed myself. I'm afraid of the weeks to come. I'm moving back home and having the car repossessed to get out from under the loan. But I'm terrified for what my future holds. Will I be this depressed and anxious all the time forever? Am I going to be stuck in a hole I'll never crawl out of? I don't know.

However the main reason why I want to kill myself is to see if anyone in my life ranging from my friends to my family would care if I disappear. I feel like most of my friends hate me and see me as annoying plus they don't give a shit about how I feel. There's also the random people who don't like me in general. I believe in becoming a spirit when you die so when I do kill myself I want to continue roaming the earth for a few hours to see how my death effects everyone in my community, family, online presence, etc. I know this sounds shitty but all of my cries for help have been ignored by everyone and at this point I'm exhausted and tired of fucking trying.

Is to be brutally tortured before being murdered . Hang me , electrocute me , stab me ( not intensely , got a lot to pay ) . Punches/kicks , being tossed around , being bullied I want it all - ALL OF IT

Beat me with hammers , cut me with blades , let it flow and let it go down - I'm so good .

( Wow its 2:55 am here and i was typing while laying down Sleepless , got a burst of sleep - closed my eyes - panicked and jumped back to coincisuness )

Slap me , verbally abuse me and beat me to death for what I've become . I know I ain't worthy of shit , I know I'm too messed up to "" help "" others and I know words don't matter but actions do and I'm sick of it 

I know I'm a clingy motherfucker and evryone hates me so please for god's sake , let me end it too . Let this blood that started it all be drowned in the head that was responsible for all of it

Let this body that was once a free bird , fly without going anywhere else just staying there , foot above the land .

Why all this ? Coz it helps and it'll be the only thing that'll do away with the incompetence im born with

1joi7wk,I’m just stuck.,"Ever since middle school I have had on and off suicidal ideations. I even used to self harm but stopped after my parents threatened to put me away somewhere. I’m 28 years old now. Went to college, got my masters, attempted law school a couple years back but was academically dismissed. Since, I’ve tried to pivot and found work then was recently laid off. I can’t help but think that no matter how hard I try, it’s not meant for me to attain the things that I want and have continued to work for. Even though I got laid off, I tried taking it as a sign and then went back to preparing to apply to law schools again. This whole process has been a lot since my initial graduation date is coming up in May and I’m seeing my friends and former classmates graduate like how I thought I would this year. I thought at this age I’d be married or at least engaged yet I’m single and trying not to compare myself to my peers who are doing all of the things I’ve been trying to get to and thought I would have by now. During times like this I just think about all of the bad that’s happened to me (even things I haven’t mentioned like being SA’d, domestic violence, racism in academia/professional spaces, being betrayed by loved ones, etc.) and no matter how much I pray, journal, exercise, etc., the positive thoughts don’t even last long. I’ve always felt like a black sheep in my family, friendships, group activities/orgs. And not to mention I have a slight speech impediment that flares up when I’m nervous so I also think that prevents me from performing my best to get jobs and even to work when i am employed. I just don’t see the point in me having worked so hard to have things constantly happening to me back to back and it feels like no one else understands my POV. Like all I’ve done has been in vain. Idk I’ve cried all day and I don’t even cry more than maybe twice a year. I’m just lost right now.

1jsjcyu,I've given myself a month. I have 28 days left.,"There is a lot of required context. I will try to keep it as brief and vague about personal details as possible. This is a burner account. God forbid anyone find out I'm planning this. 

Last year, I was relocated against my will due to my father kicking us out of the house. I currently live in the middle of nowhere. I got a job when I first moved here; I have since lost said job. I cannot afford therapy, don't have insurance, access to previous pay stubs to apply for unemployment, a college or tech degree, no specialized skills, and even if I did, no one wants to hire a tranny in a small town red state.  I don't have a car, so I would have to walk to work (as I did with my previous one). There is only so much I can do as far as getting a job, and my options have already run dry.

I have uncontrollable outbursts of anger followed by self harm and/or taking my anger out on inanimate objects. I have severe social anxiety, low self esteem, no self worth, consistent and persistent suicidal thoughts, no support system, and I've been off of my SSRI's for a year and a half because my therapist flaked out on me. I can't even afford my usual coping mechanism (getting so high that I can't even think) because I don't have money left to spend or a source of income. I know I sound like an idiot, but it was genuinely the only thing keeping me sane. 

I am writing this in a completely level headspace. I am not considering suicide out of desperation for attention or an immediate response to a traumatic event. I see this as my only rational option. I have no other choice.

1jgm7od,I think i am dying without willing to die,"I am 20 (W) and self harm for 5 years now. In the last 2 years i am doing it very extensive. I usally had a strong body. I could do whatever i desired to do. 

Untilll i tried to unalive myself. I lost a total of 500ml blood and managed to stop the bleeding even though it was hard. Somethink still holds me here , like faith that doesn't want to extinct. After seeking help and going through many therapies , i felt better. A lot better. I am not suizidal . Its even better , i want to live and never give up. 

But somehow my sefldistruction got even worse. I regually lost a lot of blood. Every 2 months or so i self harm the worst and loose always more then 1 liter of blood.

In addition i had a knee surgery and till then everthink went down.

I lost to much weight. I cant eat probably because i am constantly nausious. I have constant weakness, bad sleeping and dizziness.

I tried to find the problem but no success. Until i went to the doctor. We made a lot of check ups to see where the issue is.

My blood results came and my doctor immediatley called me , saying i need to go to the hospital because i have a big deficiency of red blood cells. 
(Normal level : >12g/dl , i have 6g/dl) (8g/dl can be already life threatening)

No wonder my body couldn't gain weight and having weakness and all that stuff. I was breaking down from the inside without noticing. Because of me loosing to much blood . My body was not able to reproduce what i have lost.

This is all so frustrating. I really try my best to not self harm, to fuel my bodys needs with good food(i love cooking) and trying to find a therapist. But my dark side/mental illness destroyes me with that shitty self distraction . As if i fight against somethink so much stronger then i am right now.

1jp7yiw,I don’t even know okay..,"I hope Reddit has no text limit because this will be LONG 

To start off from scratch. I grew up in Germany. My mother had a few boyfriends in my childhood since my father was divorced with her. And one of the boyfriends spanked me for the smallest things. That’s where it started off easily. Before it went uphill my mom found another boyfriend. And honestly? He was sweet, attractive, good work, humor, everything. We moved into his home and we had a garden. 

I cannot describe the feeling. 

The way he was so sweet and kind. The way he was carrying me. The way he supported me. The way we would bake together every week. Shopping. Everything. I cannot express how happy i was feeling. But after a year or two he genuinely started to pick up on drinking and he became abusive. 

He drank. He invited guys over on late nights. When having any issues with my mom he would say it’s my fault and scream at me, he once called me a whore/bitch. My mom therefore ran away from home since for a night leaving me alone with him. They separated. Came back. And so on. Until my mom had enough and we were at one of these woman shelter things. Personally it was good for me. She cried when we arrived..well obv. It was Christmas at the time. 

But on news year 2022 my mom came back to him for one “night.” Promising she won’t date him. Yet she kissed him, and when I saw this I wanted to cry. She asked me if she should date him again. I BEGGED her, no FORCED her to stay single.

Then after a year or something I started to self harm. Out of nowhere. Still do. It’s because of him. In my life I skipped way too many parts but my fingers hurt so I can’t type but I miss him. I miss him he was perfect why did I say no I miss him I want him back he was amazing he was perfect he was so so so so so so so so so sweet I miss having a normal family I just miss him. 


I miss him. Having severe daydreaming thinking about how things could’ve gotten better if I was with him. How I WOULD turn out. How grades would be.

1jpedis,Does this count as a suicide attempt?,"I think I may have attempted suicide yesterday, but I'm not sure. I was going to take an entire bottle of ibuprofen, so I put some pills in my mouth, and hesitated swallowing them, so I spit them out into my hand. I then ended up swallowing the ones I spit out because I didn't want to waste anything (I know it's gross, sorry). I knew that the amount I took would not be enough to kill me. Hell, I'm almost certain that even if I had taken the entire bottle, I would've lived. Anyway, I spent the night with a headache and the urge to puke, all while hoping the pills could somehow kill me in my sleep.

  
I've also done some other things that I'm not sure were suicide attempts. Last summer, I put a bunch of pills in my mouth but didn't swallow them, and I ended up spitting those out in the garbage. I was going to make an attempt, but I think that one may count as an interrupted suicide attempt. Almost three years ago, I tried to slit my neck twice, but all I did was leave red marks on my neck. The neck slitting attempts were impulsive, so I'm not sure what I was trying to do exactly. Lastly, a few months ago, I was self harming, and I truly did not care whether I bled out or got an infection and died.

1jesiaj,I want to make my death look like natural death or accidental,"

I don't want anyone to feel guilty or to cause any other kind of trouble. My family cares a lot about their reputation, and i don't want to harm their reputation by killing myself.So I as considering Amitriptyline or KCl or hypoglycemic OD and hoping it'll cause fatal Cardiac arrhythmia .  Last 2 probably won't even work if ingested, and might need a huge amount.People who know me irl  have no idea that I'm suicidal or have any other issues and I'll make sure no medicine package is found ,and hope they don't go for toxicological screening and it looks like a natural death.  Also keeping CO poisoning in mind. But i have no idea how to make it look like accidental CO poisoning without causing harm to others. Involvement of Alcohol is out of question. I'm not sure if the OD idea will work... So i hope I'll get some suggestions here.
Ps, i don't want any kind of support or help.

The 1 am to 5 am depressive drinking episode and subsequent headache didn’t help, waking up tipsy was surprisingly pleasant. This entire week has been ups and downs, and idk if its just the fact that i havent slept or eaten well mixing with the hrt or the fact that i am kinda fucked beyond belief. 20 yr old trans girl with minimal friends, no career aspirations, still living with her parents, probably has brain damage from poor childhood choices in self harm practices, like, 3, maybe four people i can consider friends who i can actually or have actually been around, and most of them are emotionally… i mean they have their own shit to deal with. I considered asking them for help when i started looking for bridges on google maps while drunk but… idk. Im kinda… bored? Done? Like… im not in imminent danger of killing myself, but the option is once again back to say hello, and its looking mighty tempting. Everyone else is struggling to build a future, chase their dreams, or whatever, and im just waiting for something to kill me. Ive had plenty of lectures about “discipline” and “motivation”and whatever, and all that ever did was make me feel inadequate enough to consider myself inferior to all my peers, and a waste of good biomass. So yeah, short of, or even with(if you consider child me’s abilities sufficient) acute mental torture, the discipline angle isn’t much help.Transitioning helped me feel less like a meat piñata that exists to be broken open for someone’s entertainment, but im still just me, and as much as my body has changed, my mind remains much the same. Plus, being a girl now just… i mean its a double edged sword considering i live in the US. Now i kinda really am a meat piñata. I assume my friends will miss me. I don’t really care too much about my family, even though maybe i should. I know my dogs would at least be sad, but like… im gonna die anyway? And sometimes id rather it not be in some dingy back alley with several knife wounds in me, or in a camp, or homeless on the street.

          I’m genuinely at the end of my rope at the point. I’ve struggled with my mental health for years due to past abuse and every time I’ve attempted to reach out I’ve been brushed off or criticized. Nobody truly cares, not even my own family, and all I’ve ever received is threats of violence in response to me opening up about self harm or suicide. Last year someone I considered a friend ruined my life by reporting to my school that I was sexually assaulted after I confined in them begging them not to tell anyone. It’s caused me so many issues. I was outed as gay and now face relentless bullying everyday at school to the point I’ve had chemicals thrown on me and people attempt to push me off second and third story balconies. My own family has essentially outcasted me for it, I’ve lost the majority of my friends, and every day I feel like I’m stuck in an endless loop of suffering. The exhaustion doesn’t stop at mental, since apparently the universe hates me for some unexplainable reason. I’ve started having cardiac related seizures and I’m now in constant debilitating pain everyday to top it all off while doctors slap heart monitors on me and treat me like a lab rat giving me no answers besides essentially ‘your heart likes to stop pumping blood’. Maybe it’s a sign, my body is giving up because it knows I’m going to kill myself anyways. I think tonight might be the night if I’m entirely honest.

1jkycju,I’m Thinking of Killing Myself…Again…,"The voices are getting louder and the light is fading away…

Usually, people that are suicidal tend to be dealing with extreme circumstances in life (e.g. illness, bullying, abuse, etc), but surprisingly this isn’t the case for me. 
Fortunately, I haven’t had any ‘traumatic’ experiences in life, but something just never felt right. For a long time I felt like my depression was invalid because nothing “bad” had happened to me, and that I would just be perceived as a ‘pick me’ or a ‘spoilt brat’ if I ever spoke about it. 
So, I just kept it inside and would harm myself in silence…

I’m not sure if anyone can relate, but I just feel so fucking empty inside man. Like absolutely fucking empty inside. I feel like I have no purpose and no drive to do anything. 
I always ask myself “Why am I here?” 
I never feel like I belong anywhere, not even with my family. Even when surrounded by my loved ones I feel so empty and life feels meaningless. It’s like nothing or no one can “save me”.

And it’s kinda hard to comprehend because I genuinely am a good girl. 4.0 gpa, working on my Master’s degree, homebody, doesn’t do drugs, small circle of friends, loving family, in good health, etc.
So I feel like I have no reason to feel like this, but idk something just never felt right and I just felt like I was going through life rather than living it. 

I’m about to be 25 and I genuinely don’t think I can do it anymore. I’m not happy, I’m empty. Life is dull and meaningless. When I was a teenager I always thought things would “get better” but they never do. I still have the deep scars on my body which signify how long I’ve been fighting these demons. It’s to the point where I don’t even care who would be sad if I’m gone, because I genuinely just can’t keep living like this.

I’m sorry, I tried,
But I just can’t keep fighting anymore 
I don’t have it in me anymore, I’m tired

1jo31qw,dont see the point in living anymore,"
hello ^^, im not sure if this is the place for this, more just writing this because ive always found writing to help me. as the title says, im pretty done with life. 

im 16 years old, turning 17 in may, and ive realized that i really do not want that. its not the age, its everything that comes with it. im behind on everything. 

due to some things when i was about 12-14 i stopped going to school for about three years and where i live doesnt allow me to skip those grades, so right now i am a soon to be 17 year old in the 8th grade. its miserable.

i have to be responsible, i have to think about getting a job, learning how to drive and so much more but i cant. i dont feel my age, i dont feel like anything. when i fail an exam, in my head its worse for me, how can a 16 y/o fail an 8th grade math exam?? 

i keep seeing others my age talking about colleges, what majors theyre taking, crying when they dont get accepted into their dream college and celebrating when they do. why dont i get that? why does something i decided when i was just a kid who didnt see a point in life ruining my current life? why dont i get to live?

i have no real friends, a few online ones but none i can truly speak to and say i know. as for people i know in person i can feel a distance. the age gap. its odd it really is. i hate it but not having friends would make me stand out even more. 

ive held out a year, its not as bad as i expected but the longer i do this, as i get older, the more miserable i am. my only relationships have been online or a few in PRIMARY school. 

i think and talk the way a thirteen year old does because thats what im surrounded by. i keep doing things thinking itll be the one thing i enjoy and that makes everything else better but it never works. any hobby i try, any self destructive habit i pick up in (about 5 days clean from self harming, not much but somewhat silly that im writing this after trying to become clean haha). 

i dont think i wish to rewind time, not like i can, but i dont blame my past self about this at all and i think thats the worst part about all of this. if given the choice id do the exact same thing. i couldnt take being seen by the world at the time, everything was overwhelming and i just wanted to hole up in myself. i dont blame me at all. as much as i wish i did i really dont. i dont have anything to blame aside from the situation which just makes me seem pathetic.

1jm7368,I got nobody to share my little things in my life,"Had a breakup about 6 months ago,  not able to move on, she was my everything. Always loved her, she always loved me too. She was my world, we would talk anything to everything, I wouldn't hide anything for her, I was that comfortable with my love. I think she also never hid anything from me, I mean she told me how she started to have feelings for someone else too (girl) while she also loved me, I think this tells what level of comfort we had towards each other, some complicated situations happened, now she is with that other person she started having feelings.

I sacrificed myself for her gf, and had to tell her I didn't love her, or else she wouldn't have left me. Her gf was near suicidal because her ex commited suicide, and she started to hate me. My gf had to lie to be able to talk to me.

I personally didn't like that, thought about this in the future, realised how devasting this would be if she keeps on lying and eventually her gf gets to know about this. I mean at some point she has to know. Decided to show her through actions that I didn't care. I noticed how much I had to change myself to interpret that. She asked me always, I said yes I did love her. But never showed it back through actions.

Last day, she asked me if I loved her. I kept silent interpreting that I didn't. She left

Now she is happier than ever before with her gf.

 Im having suicidal thoughts now, on one side I think about how I fixed things, I admit I had to do it in a path in which I hurted her a lot, but I didn't know what to do at the point, her gf wouldn't talk to me or something. She hated me. My ex told me how she doesn't have feelings for me anymore and that she can't see me as a lover again. I think it's cause of her gf she tells me that, she doesn't wanna be with me and her gf now that ik not there, which is perfectly fine. I do feel a bit betrayed here

But I always loved her, it hurts a lot upto a point, I have literally heart ache and breathing problems every night. I'm living off of the hope, she might breakup with her gf someday and maybe give me a chance, I would want her to give me a chance if that happens.
But on the other side I don't want them to breakup, cause that would be really hurtful for he'd, she'd be all alone. I'm scared for her if she falls into that situation, i sacrificed my lovers happiness and future and ended up hurting myself

1jm4t25,Dating Apps Are Making Me Want To End It,"The title is a bit of an oversimplification, but overall it's still the case.

A little over a year ago I was in a relationship with a girlfriend I loved quite a lot. But the relationship ended extremely suddenly and pretty much out of nowhere. I really haven't been able to process it even over a year later, honestly. It still hurts so much every day. That alone often makes me want to end it.

But then on top of that I've been on a dating app for about a year now. I haven't used it completely consistently in that time, but still quite a bit. And I'm still single after an entire year of trying. This is having two effects on me.

The first is that it is making me feel extremely insecure about my appearance. I already have body dysmorphic disorder, so I already have quite a lot of emotional and complex feelings about how I look. And then being on a dating site like this on top of that and basically feeling constantly rejected is making me feel utterly disgusting quite a lot of the time. Which is destroying what little remained of my self-esteem. And that is also making me want to end it.

And then secondly, it is making me feel a combination of frustrated and hopeless.

Frustrated, because I want a relationship again and all of the things that are part of it. And I also very much need sex and that has also been freaking torture not having that for over a year. It is driving me mad all on its own, on top of not having a girlfriend to talk to, hug, kiss, go out with, build a life with, etc.

Hopeless because it has been like a year now. And I'm really seriously starting to feel trapped and like I'll never find someone again.

For the record, I also have social anxiety and am quite isolated so meeting someone without an app is extremely unlikely for me, even if I could (which, at this point I'm insecure enough that I'm not sure I could even in that case, maybe I'm just that repulsive and awful).

And that hopelessness is the final thing that is making me just want to give up on life.

And then it's not like I have a great life other than that. Other than that my life is messed up and empty and I suffer from depression as well.

So my life is in ruins, I suffer from severe depression, sometimes it hurts so much what happened with my previous girlfriend that the only way I can make it hurt less is through self-harm and it makes me want to die immediately, then on top of that I feel disgusting because of being on the dating app, frustrated and utterly hopeless that I'll find anyone again ever because I'm starting to feel like such a disgusting awful person that nobody wants me.

It's getting to be too much for me.

I want the pain to end. I want the misery to end. I want to feel something positive. And I've pretty much lost hope that I can at this point in any way other than offing myself.

There are just so many reasons to end it (even more than I mentioned here) that it has become ridiculous not to. I know that rationally, but I continuously find it hard to accept emotionally. I didn't want my life to be this way, I didn't want it to end this way, I want to believe that there is some hope, even though there probably isn't.

And being on these dating apps makes me feel so disgusting, frustrated, worthless and hopeless. But I have no other way to even try to find someone else. So I keep having to use them and I feel just completely awful every time I do.

I'm writing this in no small part because I just finished swiping on one of them.

1j6z1gm,"Within 24 hours, I'm going to suicide. And for really dumb shit too.","I know people in this subreddit, or just people in any venting community, endure shit that are worse than me. What I'm going to tell you here, it's basically a fraction of what people have endured. Matter of fact, some people might just call it stupid. Waste of a life. Why did you die of such stupid reasons? But yeah, I think that's gonna be whatever. Shit at me all you want.

I don't have shit parents. Matter of fact, I have great parents and grandparents, And that's probably the only thing I'm going to regret leaving behind. They've done so much for me, now I'm going to betray their hearts. I lived a comfortable life some people would actually commit murder to get in my shoes, and yet, I want to just quit it all.

I'm a pretty weird person. I hate every act I did in elementary and middle school. I was a weird kid, always talking about dumb shit. Rightfully, I was bullied for the entire middle school. Nobody really liked me, my ""friends"" don't care about me, I'm probably easily replaceable as hell. Everybody in my school hates me and probably wants me to die. And my family is forced to love me.

I can't go through a single day at school without hearing insults of me. The hatred is there, I can feel it even if they don't tell me. That I'm a fatass, ugly, weird, stupid individual. And it is true: I am fat, I am ugly, I'm definitely weird, and my academics are shit. Everything I do is shit. Some might say I have low self-esteem: I've never went to a therapist, all my issues are undiagnosed. I don't think I have low self-esteem: it's not being pessimistic, it's being realistic.

About this time I picked up chess, and soon enough, I got addicted to it. Whenever I wasn't doomscrolling, I played chess. But as the insults keep getting more extreme and I become more and more aware of it, I start to isolate myself to no longer hear those insults. I hated school, but my parents keep forcing me to go to it. And in isolation, I played chess, nonstop: I can't think of anything but chess, and it slowly replaced my life purpose, from being a decent kid, to just become something like 2000 elo on chess.com (which I eventually did).

But as chess became my life purpose, I slowly start detaching myself from real life. Insults were still there, though less frequent as I entered high school: kids become more mature and more sensitive. I still know they put a barrier on me: I feel unwanted and alone. And so, I enter isolation again. And chess was one of my only ways to cope with life: it was relatively everything to me. I start to hit myself (never committed self-harm because I'm a pussy), I would torture myself mentally everytime I did play a match.

Mentally soon become physically. Results decide my mood. I can go from having a very good day to a really bad day: I can go from being very happy to depression. I know I have to quit, but literally, what is the purpose of my life if I quit chess? Because chess is the only thing that actually associates a value to me. It makes me feel valuable and stand out just a little bit, covering up all of my flaws. But with every mistakes I make in game, I start to smash my table, pull my hair, slap myself, throw some books, hating everything I've ever lived for.

A couple days ago it was my birthday, I turned 15. The very next day I went to an MUN conference. And soon enough, it became clear: it's me the problem. Nobody actually likes me, I'm a really hateable guy. I can't lobby, had no power, my questions were messed up. No insults this time but it's clear that I'll forever be unable to socialize. And I think everybody in this world, if they see and get to know me, they'll be disgusted.

To cope with the mutual hatred, I start to play even more chess. I can't live without this shit anymore. Lose, lose, lose, tilt, tilt, tilt, and with that, I went insane. I don't see the purpose of living anymore. The only thing that gave me a will to live betrayed me. It got a control of my life and it's fucking me over.

And so today, I decided to myself I am done. I quit chess, my only will to live. I quit life as well. Within 24 hours I'll commit suicide in the building I hated going to the most. The building where it tortured me. If it goes through, great, if it fails, doesn't matter, my life would be wasted anyways, it's already wasted. Nobody actually likes me.

So shit on me all you want in the comments. Tell me that people have endured shit a thousand times worse than me. Because at the end of the day, my feelings are invalidated. It holds zero value. My feelings don't matter. Every second, two people die, and the Earth still spins regularly. So my death won't have any consequences to the functioning of the society.

May the school host a party in celebration to my death. I'll gladly sponsor it.

1jq5bi9,Benadryl overdose attempts,"I've tried to overdose on benadryl for a total of 6 times. Each time I upped the dosage. Each time I woke up wondering why am I not dead. The first time I did it I took about 21 50mg pills. Something I was prescribed for insomnia. Then that prescription was taken away from me and they gave me an entirely new med that gave me pseudo seizures. Which drove me to buy my own Benadryl because I couldn't handle those pseudo seizures and the stresses of life. The stress in life I've been dealing with is that my own wife accused me of harming our 2 month old son. Even after the hospital proved I didn't she still felt that  I did someway somehow and has kept me away from him. The separation from not being able to be apart of his life and see him grow and be happy kills me. And drives me to these decisions of worst case scenario. Which I had decided to take benadryl. Taking the same dosage equivalent that I sent myself to the hospital for. I had to take twice the amount of pills due to the over the counter dosage being 25 mg which meant I had to take 42 pills. It was hard to swallow so many. I felt the effects about an hour later. Blurred vision, vertigo, numbness, weird redness of hands and feet as if the body was struggling to move blood back and forth. So I laid down and expected to pass in my sleep. Except I woke up as if I had the best sleep. Yes I was extremely thirsty but that was it. I let a few days pass. The next weekend came I upped the pill count to 60. Hoping that would do the job this time. Again similar results. However, this time there was a hangover effect. So I once again wait to the next weekend in hopes of finally ending it all this time with 100 pills. Approximately 2500 mg of benadryl. Something that should've killed me. Again it didn't. I don't know why it didn't. I'm not exaggerating on these pill counts either. I documented the amount and times in a suicide letter/journal. Where i ponder as to if life is even real. I wanted to die but something or someone is preventing it. The 100 pills definitely gave me a harder hangover effect to overcome and if I took more it more likely would've done the job. But I thought about the what if it doesn't. What am I supposed to do then? I'm already in therapy. Not just for these thoughts, but to help me get over my past from growing up but PTSD as well. Something I got from my first 4 years in the military. I'm not looking for help nor for an explanation as to why it didn't work. I felt that this was a safe sub reddit where I can put this out there. So it's not bogging my mind down. I don't need my parents to think I tried to off myself more times after the two trips to the psyc ward I took already.

1jd6eec,mental hospitals/wards advice,"do mental health hospitals, or mental wards, take people who are just there because they hurt or want to themselves really badly and not actually end their  lives?

any advice on how I should pick one ?

 I don’t wanna be in one with patients who are prone to violence n stuff,  I wanna be in a ward with just people who have depression and harm anxiety n stuff.

 I also have O.C.D. so I want a single room and be able to wear a face mask , do they let you or is it a safety hazard to wear one around other patients? I know there probably isint a way around eating , I’m going to have to take off a face mask n the eating area with everyone , I hope they will let me sit like 2/6 feet away from others while I eat ? doubt that would happen though probably would be a full cafeteria. No room or maybe seating arrangements ?

What I want out of it : meeting people like me (depression n stuff ) and learning coping skills/communication from mental heath people. Forced routine, idk if they all do this but having to wake up a certain time , eat , n other things may be helpful and teach me to be more in the habit of taking care of myself 

I’m not gonna go into details about my mental heath , but  I’m not suicidal And people have told me I need professional help with things . 

im posting this here because I’m not sure where else . I found this Reddit and thought people here have probably been in the hospital . How was your experience If you or someone you know has been?

I have been suicidal for years. My parents don't know. The internet doesn't know. I've planned what I'm wanting to do now for months, I've been donating my spending money to people who need it, I've slowly cut off everyone I know. I have avoided social connections for years because I am extremely paranoid of hurting them, and I don't want them to get too attached and worry themselves sick. I just cut off my long-distance s/o, the only person who even knows about my suicidal thoughts.

I have a specific plan of when and how I'm going to do it. I want to do it so badly. My father lambasted me when he found out about my self harm. He asked me if it was my new way of getting attention. I never called for help again.

1jp80u1,No motivation to do anything anymore and I think I'd be better off dead.,"[21F] Hello everyone. I need to vent, and I have no one to vent to, I wish I could get some support, but I know this post will get ignored like most of mine do because nobody cares about me. 

I haven't gone outside in God knows how long, and if I have it's been for a very short while, a couple hours at most. I haven't gone to school almost the entire year, and I'm in my final year of university, I'm probably not graduating. My mother will be very disappointed in me and I don't even want to think about how she'll abuse me when she finds out I'm likely not gonna finish university after she helped pay some of my tuition. I have no motivation to go to school, I haven't had any since I enrolled, and over the last three years I've been in school I've tried to motivate myself without success. Each year I just had less and less attendance. I don't want to learn anything, I feel exhausted and drained, I don't like any field, I'm not interested in any careers, and unfortunately if I want a job with a liveable wage in my country I not only need my bachelors degree but I should also complete masters. I can't take a break because I know I won't start again if I do, plus, I would need to get a job, because my mother isn't going to let me sit and do nothing. I can't motivate myself to get out of bed and go to school, let alone work a shitty job that's probably not even gonna pay well. 

I am very lonely, and it hurts so bad, that only fuels my isolation, because I have nothing to go outside for. I hate strangers, I hate crowded places and I don't want to hang out places with less people because I am a woman and scared for my safety, the only reason I would have to go outside would be friends or a partner, and I have neither. Before you go and say that ""of course you don't have a social circle if you never go outside!"" I've been outside my entire damn life and I still never made any friends. I've been to school, places people my age hang out, extracurricular activities etc. over the years yet I haven't ever had real or proper friends, why would it be any different now? 

I'm also incredibly unattractive, I'm fat and ugly and while theoretically I could fix the fat part in practice I can't without slipping back into ED territory like every time I tried to lose weight over the years, the thought of dieting again is extremely distressing and triggering for me. I'm also weird as fuck and have an unappealing personality because I'm autistic on top of everything so I can't even attract someone with that. Although even if I had a great personality people wouldn't give a shit because the outside is repulsing. 

I feel so useless and hopeless, I wish I could just die somehow, I've tried numerous times over the years to commit suicide yet I've always been unsuccessful because I've always been too much of a pussy to do it properly. I've been self-harming for a long time now just to cope with it all. I'm too scared to try to commit again, because what if something good is waiting for me? Then again, I couldn't possibly regret it, because I'd be dead. I don't see any other way out of my pain and anguish other than death, I've tried so hard for so long to get better and nothing works, I've only gotten worse.

I was born in a family who should have never had children, and not for reasons typical of abusive families. It's this strange gray area where from the top down any fuctional adult would understand how crushing things would become for me in particular. I feel like a fucking pussy for even putting the words to this in a cohesive passage but I've never been so compelled to make a confession.

Let me first say that I don't have any direct intentions of ending my life, at least not in the present moment. This is purely a cathartic effort toward trying to erase the feelings that sway in and out of my life on a completely regular basis. The passive ideation has been something I've fought against since I was young. That being said, it's a fucking monster of a feeling that grows dramatically each time it rears its ugly head. I'm giving as full of a context as I possibly can because I wholeheartedly don't even give a fuck if anyone reads this in its entirety, I need to let it out.

I was born to a woman and man who hated each other, a tale as old as time itself. My mother had a son who is 18 years my senior with someone who wasn't my father, and two years after me, my parents had another kid, my younger sister. My father fucking hated my older brother, and now than I've grown up I understand it was for good reason. If I gave the full context on that it would take actual days to type out, but the short end of it is he was an undisciplined troublemaker who put himself and my whole family at risk of being in serious harm on several different occasions throughout my entire life. For example I was too young to recall specifics here but there was some kind of incident where he owed some bad people money and they tried to kidnap my infant sister or something insane like that. All that aside, my father had raised me in a manner that suggested I was a ""bad seed"" just like my half-brother. This is where things start becoming strange.

About a year after my sister is born, myself being 3 years old, my mother and father attended some kind of friend's get together and left us with an aunt overnight. At this party, my mother suffered a near fatal head injury that changed the trajectory of all our lives completely. Skipping forward quite a bit, after months spent in the hospital and in physical therapy, my mother came home and was a noticably different woman. The details are hazy because I was a child, but the consensus of this all after growing up and talking with my extended family was that it was an attempted murder spearheaded by my father to either get rid of her completely or have her sent away because she owned half of his contracting business. I know how unbelievable this sounds, but my father was a maniacal man and there were instances in his life prior to me existing where this would make a lot of sense. 

A little more fast forwarding, my mother divorced him, and by the time I was 10 years old or so he lost visitation rights to my sister and I cause he couldn't stop abusing me. It's been about 15 years since I've seen him and I had never realized the detriment of not having a father figure until I grew up and was catapulted into the real world. Not only did I never have a man teaching me how to do man shit, the only person I had to teach me anything was a jaded woman who only had half her brain to work with after her injury. She also had a severe distaste and distrust for men considering all that had gone on with my father, all of the trouble my brother put us through, and the grim reality that she was raped as a teenager and that was how my brother came to exist in the first place. 

With my lifetime of a sob story watered down and out of the way, this left me vastly underprepared to take on adult life. I've been ridiculed and bullied out of just about every serious job I've ever had for my lack of experience and general common sense. I started a career in carpentry and went through so many layoffs in the span of 4 years that I lost my apartment and my car and even the girlfriend I had at the time who ended up having a kid with a stranger while we were arguing. I'm 25 now and I've had to move back with my mom, working a dead end job to dig myself out of the hole I fell into. I've been at it for a year, I've made progress, I've even gotten myself another car, but through all of it I can't keep up with the relentless balancing of ""things are going to be okay"" and ""I want to end it.""

This post is extremely lengthy, but I've never been able to express these feelings honestly due to how frequently my older brother would threaten to take his life to get attention from my family. I live in constant agony internalizing these feelings because I know there's not a single person on earth I can safely share this with. I'm trying so hard to learn a skill that will make me valuable in American life so I can survive on my own because all I've ever wanted was to be able to survive quietly, but things are starting to seem grim and nobody wants to give me the time of day. 

I kind of lost my way typing this out, I guess all I wanted to say was I admit that I am suicidal. I've been fighting the good fight for years but it's manifested into something that's equally as strong as my will to fight it, and it's always getting stronger. I have never been professionally diagnosed with anything but PTSD and some kind of depression from when I was examined after my parents divorce, court orders and whatnot. The point of the post was to get this out of my heart and I do feel some strange sense of relief. If you decided you gave a shit enough to read all this, thanks. I hope we'll all be okay.",2025-04-04 04:28:48,1,2,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1jr02ir/life_is_strange/,life strange,0.146,0.781,0.072,-0.9987,high
1jq6bbx,my life is such a joke,"I've spent about half my life dealing with mental illness. I'm 15. 

I can't help but feel that I have a miserable existence. My home life is fine, my parents love me and we aren't struggling financially or anything. I have a great group of friends who are arguably closer than my family. My grades are fine. I'm physically pretty healthy. People say that I should be grateful, and that I have no reason to be upset. And yet I am.

I started out having trouble sleeping. My mind would always be full and I could never fully relax. Then, I started getting intrusive thoughts about awful things happening to myself and my family. I realize now that this is because of my anxiety disorder, but I never recognized it or even knew that it was unusual until years later. I developed horrible social anxiety, which turned into low self esteem and then into depression. As the years went on, I got worse. I started cutting and had suicidal thoughts. I'm 17 months clean from self harm, but I still think about it almost all the time.

Recently, like this past month or so, I've been feeling angry for no reason. I keep saying rude things to my friends and pushing them away. I want to be alone and isolated, but I also want attention and love at the same time I started feeling particularly suicidal today. I probably won't go through with it. My mind tells me that since my life has been more negative than positive for years and years, I should just get it over with and die now. This happens a lot and I never go through with it or even do anything. I just... I don't know anymore. I guess I'm just ranting into the void...

1jhnsmp,BPD is deadly,"I can't live with the pain of BPD. I can't tell what's BPD delusion vs how I really feel. I have lost everyone in my life including my parents who abandoned me. My ex from 5 years ago led me to believe he wanted me only to start seeing a different girl. 3 years we didn't see each other and now in the lowest point in my life things magically work out to see each other and that's it? Seems cruel. I know I made these choices but I can't help but choose other people I love over me. 

These types of reasons seem stupid to people but you don't understand this has been the same pattern since I was 15 years old. My ex said the only reason he talks to me is because he doesn't want me to kill myself"". I am a burden and I can't help but always choose hope that makes me even more delusional. 

I'm also autistic. It has all always been too much. My 25th birthday is in 3 days but I didn't think I'd make it. I always dreamed I'd be jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge even tho I live in MN lmao. Helium has been my decided method for a bit over a year now.

 I relapsed self harm again. I can't explain how I feel I want to crawl out of my own skin. Narcissistic abusive relationship, then an abusive work place, then I got raped again, and now the only person I love unconditionally has abandoned me.

I'm so tired of living this life. I only have a few months til I graduate with my masters and then I have to file for bankruptcy. It's all been a shit slide downhill. I've already endured a lot of abuse growing up. I just want to feel free not trapped in this body not bound to these intense feelings.

 People don't see me as an autistic girl with BPD they see me as a person with horrible personality traits. I don't want to live to 25. I don't want to live in this pain where the only second of relief is when I cut. The moment I thought I was finally going to find comfort it was ripped from me. 

I can't do this. I have been in treatment programs, therapy, DBT programs. What I need is love not therapy. I need love that will not find me in time.

I want to go home. ",2025-03-23 04:13:00,7,3,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1jhnsmp/bpd_is_deadly/,bpd deadly,0.173,0.721,0.107,-0.9885,high

1jo0ynl,Depressed College Student Vent,"I am currently a junior at college and I have been struggling immensely with my depression this year. I had a really bad flare up recently which led to a relapse in self harm and suicidal ideation that hasnt been this bad since high school.I just feel nothing most days and so apathetic towards everything in life. I find it hard to leave my room much less get outside and attend my classes which has made me miss like 3 weeks so far which has put me so far behind and I am struggling to catch up while still feeling paralyzed in my bed and skipping class most days. I want to force myself to care about classes so badly but it is hard when most of my day is spent thinking about killing myself or harming myself. 

I reached out to my university’s mental health crisis center and got a 15-minute call where they read back my issues to me and then sent an email for other resources which made me feel so uncared for and stupid for even reaching out. I feel so alone and stupid over not being able to function right now as its my first year living away from family and my boyfriend has been incredibly busy and we havent been talking much and I dont want to burden him with constant talk of my depression.

1jp3g1j,I fear I could attempt again,"Hello everyone.

I'm not even sure what I am looking for. I kind of attempted suicide in January of this year, but was found and stopped by my sister before I could harm myself. I willingly went back home, talked to the cops my mom had called (they were really supportive) and that was it. I then told my psychiatrist and therapist about this and we adjusted my meds.

Things are somewhat better, but from that day I've never been the same. I'm afraid that, now that I attempted once, I could do it again if just the situation gets worse. Today was a really rough day and I spoke both to my psychiatrist and my primary care doctor (I have an appointment scheduled with my therapist on Thursday). Today I was able to stay home, but tomorrow I'll go to work.

Things are rough, even though they shouldn't be. I have everything and everything is going good, I don't know if and when I should call emergency services.

1joo28i,just a rant,"hey guys, i just need to vent a little before i explode. i'm so tired, tired of feeling like this. i know it’s depression creeping back in—i can literally feel it sitting on my chest. I just wish I could be a normal teenager, one of those shallow ones whose biggest worry is finding the perfect outfit for the next concert or planning the ultimate sleepover for their huge group of friends. but no, i’m me, and i’ve been like this for as long as i can remember.

i’ve always felt alone or left out, either by family or friends. as a kid, i just wanted to feel okay around people, to not feel like the weird one or like they were getting tired of me being there. i remember that feeling so good because i still feel it today. back then, i didn’t really care much—i was just a kid. but now… now i know how much all of that affects me.

anyway, i'm going off track. I just wanted to say that it's getting harder to stay here every day, especially when there's nothing really keeping me here. i guess my mom, maybe. sometimes i feel like she's just as lonely as i am. i wish i had siblings so they could take care of her after i’m gone. but it's just me, and i have to deal with that.

i've thought about numbing myself with medications just to feel a little better. the thought crosses my mind a lot, but i’m scared of getting addicted—like i did with self-harm—so instead, i bought a coloring book to pass the time. Hopefully, it helps for now.

1jde5ja,Guilt over taking brother to er for suicidal thoughts?,"Not sure if this is allowed here but I took my brother to the er two nights ago because he was having a crisis, had self harmed, and was saying he wanted to put a gun to his head. I sat with him at the er but they wanted to keep him overnight so I left, and yesterday he called me and said they had transferred him to another facility and it wasn't what he expected, they had no mental health professionals there for him to talk to because it was Sunday, and he is unsure when he's going to be able to leave. He also said most of the people there are there for completely different reasons and I have heard bad things about this hospital they took him to. I'm also worried they're going to charge him an insane amount of money and it's going to be my fault that I added more financial stress on him when he's already having problems with that. 

Anybody have any experience with going to the er for suicidal thoughts? I feel so guilty, he's trapped in a bad place now because of me with no way to know when he's going to leave, but I also couldn't have left him at home alone when he felt like that.

1jc64qr,Im a terrible person and I want to take my life.,"This is a vent because I have no where else to turn


Hi, I (18F) am a senior in high school and I have caused so much pain to the people around me in these 4 years. Ive had everything fall apart around me 2 times already. I have no access to any therapy and I was just recently put on medication.
I have hurt so many people and have done so much wrong to everyone in my community at school, especially my theatre group. That i see no point in living.
I have talked bad about almost everyone in my group, I have accidentally caused problems with people. I have done so much wrong and even if its never my intention to hurt I still do.
I hate being alive because my mere existence in life just hurts people
My ex hates me because of who I am and I dont blame them
My friends hate me because of who I am and I dont blame them
I hate myself too more than I can put into words
Nothing I do can fix me and I will grow up and continue to cause more harm. I dont see a point in being alive anymore if I just cause pain.
In 9th grade I talked bad about my old friends and theyve said theyve forgiven me because they said they saw change, but I see no change. I am still me. Everytime I am mean its like q different person because I know the real me and I know this isnt like me. I say I hate no one and deep down I know I dont so why do i do this? I want everyone to just leave me and I know they all will. I hate being around everyone because I know eventually I will hurt them. I hate myself and every time i look at myself I want to scream. I start a new relationship or friendship and wonder “how long until they leave me too?” 
I pushed a talking stage away because I felt he would hate me too. So why am I like this? I don’t understand myself and don’t recognize myself. I have a load of mental health problems due to childhood trauma and my brother’s passing but is that an excuse for my horrible actions? Its not, It really isnt. I have no access to anything and am left to my own devices to figure stuff out. I hate who I am and don’t see myself making it to college.
Bad people dont deserve to live so there is no exception for me.
It takes a lot to know when youre a bully and a bad person and sit back and not try and change. Ive done that for 2 years now, I have not tried to change or improve myself only tried to find excuses.
It makes it worse knowing I am a bad person and continue to do what I know makes me bad.
I am two faced, petty, jealous, a bully, a follower, manipulative, and so many other bad traits that add on. I cant afford to hurt anyone else 
I have hurt 2 people already recently that don’t deserve it and if I speak to anyone around me itll sound like a sympathy card, i dont want sympathy i just want to disappear from peoples lives for good.
I am no good for anyone anymore. 
I feel as if people would be so much happier if I was gone and if I left. People seem much happier without me in their life so why should I be alive anyways? I hate being around people and I hate being alive. All of my friends have turned against me because I am who I am. Im a bully, and thats all I will ever be. I cant stand me and I know other people cant stand me. People have unfriended me and have called me out on my behavior so many times and I keep making excuses. I will never change ans they all know it too. I just want to disappear for good, then everyones lives would just be better.
I am sorry to all ive hurt and I am sorry that I am who I am, I hope you never meet someone like me again. I hope you all live wonderful lives like you deserve. I am not sure I will ever be better and do better so this is my final option.
I love you all, even if all ive done is caused harm.

1jm8p31,the end as I see it fit,"I’m 22. On track to graduate this December with a degree in Anthropology, and minors in biology and forensic sciences. I’m being honored at an award ceremony April 9th, which is also my partners birthday.

The whole world has always been ahead of me. My future has been bright. I have a stable, solid, beautiful life. I’ve never been happy to live on. 

I’ve been passively suicidal for the past 8 years, and was actively suicidal the 2 years prior to those. On 9/27/15 my mom found out that my dad was cheating on her, and I overheard everything. I’ve never been the same after that. Even though I’ve forgiven my father, my parents are still together, and my brother knows nothing of the sort.

I’ve been in this terrifying cycle of putting myself in dangerous situations, being hurt and abused by the people I put so much trust into, and I know it’s all a part of life. I beat anorexia, I beat a self harm addiction, and I’ve beat so much more. But this empty pit inside of me is one I could never get rid of. 

I’ve gotten hobbies, became an outstanding student, started pushing past all the depressive weight. All I found was that underneath it all, I still don’t feel right. I have it all. I always have. I’m just the problem. I have amazing friends, a supportive family, and so much else.

It gets harder and harder to live for other people. I don’t know if they can see through me or not, but I’ve been ready. For the past 4 years since I’ve left my parents house, I’ve been planning who I’ll give what to, trying to buy less stuff for everyone to clean up when I leave, making sure that everybody has what they need before I go. 

I just feel myself getting weaker. Today my pet mouse died. That was the one loose end I couldn’t tie up if I left. I don’t know anybody who could’ve taken care of him in my absence. 

My partner is out of the house for the weekend. I can’t stop thinking about packing up my stuff into labeled boxes and writing my letters. The thing that keeps me here is that I wouldn’t want to traumatize anybody with finding me. I watched a man jump in front of a train about a decade or so ago. Watching him be cleaned up, remembering his face before, it’s never left me. Years after that when I was 17 my best friends neighbor killed himself. I watched his wife scream in their backyard on her hands and knees in the rain. I saw her pain for what it was. It filled me with guilt that I’d ever want to do that to someone else.

The pressure building inside me to do something is deafening. I’m 22. My life is great. I just can’t enjoy it. I’ve tried so much to get past this. I just can’t. I’m planning to be done getting my things in order in mid May at the end of my semester. 

I’m ready now, as I’ve been for 10 years. I’ve tried everything I can think of. What can I do? What can I do to soften the blow? What can I try that I haven’t tried? What should I see that I haven’t seen? ",2025-03-29 02:23:14,3,2,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1jm8p31/the_end_as_i_see_it_fit/,end see fit,0.11,0.775,0.115,0.7406,high

1jgcpqj,"3/21/25, My Bf Ghosted Me For Weeks And I Blame Myself. If Anyone Can Help, Please Do. (TW: Self Harm)","Hello everyone! my name is Kyle, i'm 15 and i am seeking advice and possible closer on a relationship that i've been having for months. i'm new to Reddit so to make things easy for you people, I've added titles on everything to make it easier to follow/read. (sorry for bad grammar)

**Background:**

For the sake of privacy i will refer to my Boyfriend as 'Bf'

So my entire life living with my parents was just homophobic, they won't ever accept me for being gay and constantly tell me that ""the devil is inside you"" and ""your not normal"" so obviously, being labeled a freak every time i bring up my sexuality i don't really like my parents. Furthermore my school life isn't great with everybody in the school being homophobic and constantly bullying me for my sexuality. i struggle with mental health issues and attempted suicide multiple times.

it also feels as if i've lost everything since my friends left me, my family hates me, and my dad, (the only person who accepted me) got divorced and i'm not allowed to visit him as well as other personal things had happened which caused me to have a bleak and dark view of the world.

So when i finally found somebody who treated me perfectly, who spoke and told me everything i've ever wanted to hear; i immediately fell in love.

so what's the main issue? well he lives in another country so it's long distance. i don't mind it however, because it kinda makes it easier to hide right?

**The Real Issue**

i have always had a rough side to me, i've always been used to people calling me ""dumb, stupid, idiot"" and because of that, i have always kinda thought that it would be okay to treat others that way. throughout our relationship, me and Bf joked to each other and i've always naively used those negative words; even making fun of the things he likes and loves. i constantly remind him to tell me if i have gone too far. to me it was all jokes, but in self reflection.. i think that i hurt him.. i'm not sure but that's what i believe.

above all that my mother began to pressure me into taking certain pills which she said ""would fix you""

because of this sudden pressure as well as abuse that had never really been there before from my mother to be straight, i told Bf to have one final call with each other, then we'd just continue with only text and send voice messages and such.

i started the call with him on February 28... to me the call went well.. for me. in one part of the call, Bf was taking medication that he said ""someone gave me"" so me as the worried boyfriend that i am got a little scared over what he was taking. to make him stop, i called him stupid, dumb, idiot... and i don't know why i did this, it's so not me.. and looking back on it all, i really truly feel bad.

**Aftermath**

After the call, i texted Bf and got no response. i texted again.. no response.

The following day, i texted again, and again later on. i kept getting more worried and stressed about Bf. i kept telling myself that something could've gone wrong, what if he's hurt??

on March 1 Bf texted me back and he completely ignored every question i asked. ""why did you ignore me"" ""what happened?"" ""are you okay"" all nothing. all he did was change the topic.

He has still ignored me and every time i text him he ignores me. i'm just 15 and i urge anyone who's reading this to please give me advice. i tried ever thing but he keeps trying to distance himself from me.

It's been a week since it happened and i still find my self having random bursts of sadness and despair out of nowhere, even having Panick attacks at times. All i want is peace, all i want is to be happy, to be who i am, to be myself. i'm sorry for all i've hurt, i'm sorry for Bf, and if your reading this.. i'm sorry i wasted your time.

Life to me right now has little to no meaning, the only reason i didn't end it all is because i'm too scared. if anybody here has advice or can help me, then please do. Thank you all, i hope for all who reads this to have a wonderful day/night.",2025-03-21 12:18:27,1,2,therapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1jgcpqj/32125_my_bf_ghosted_me_for_weeks_and_i_blame/,", bf ghosted weeks blame . anyone help , please . tw self harm",0.159,0.752,0.088,-0.9966,high

No actual physical harm is being done.

But I had a thought last night and wanted to ask others (partly to get it out of my head) 

I'm 38 and been single basically my entire life. Never in a serious relationship and while the few people I've tried to date have had mixed results for the most part most days I'm content living alone and being single. Some recent financial fears about if I get sick or hurt I'm screwed but  beyond that ive never had a strong drive to be in a serious  relationship. I'm not bitter towards women I know its on me to out myself out there more. Some days I feel lonely but they are few and far between. I'm not against being with someone it just eh. I dunno hard to explain

But the thought I had was ""Is being perpetually single and living alone unconscious form of self harm?"" 

I can't tell if my mind was trying to be therapeutic and rip the band aid off. Or just intentionally mean cause I've been making progress in therapy and this is part of it too.

When I got to my session, I explained my condition and what I fantasize about. Partway through, the therapist just got up then said she couldn’t do this and offered to reschedule me with someone else. She also told me I should stay away from my girlfriend until I resolve this even though I already explained that I have never done anything to harm her or anyone in general. I tried telling her that it stays in fantasy and that I know how to differentiate reality from fantasy.

This has left me feeling embarrassed with myself. Maybe this wasn’t the therapist’s intention, but I think the fantasy is gone. I don’t know how long it will last but hopefully forever.

1jblknp,Was this therapy visit ok or weird?,"My wife just took our 11 year old daughter to a child therapist (LPCC) for ADHD which has been difficult to control and getting worse as she gets closer to puberty. Today was our first meeting and in the first 5 minutes the therapist asked her if she ""ever thinks about killing herself or killing anyone else"". I get that's probably a standard screening question but it seemed an odd way to word it. My wife asked why she asked that and the therapist responded ""we don't want to hear about this stuff for the first time on a police report."" 

Then the therapist let my wife know that in future meetings she would meet with our daughter alone; neither my wife or I would be allowed to go in with her. There was no comment about how we would be getting updates or coordinate what we do at home with how her therapy is going. 

All of this seems over the top as we are just looking for help with her adhd. We had zero concerns about depression or anxiety, and she has never said anything about self-harm. And 11 just seems too young to not involve the parents in some way, even if it's just a short update at the end of each visit.

In our first session I was very honest and told her that I have a history of SH but we haven’t talked about it yet and I don’t know how to bring it up. I don’t actually know how she can help once we have talked about it either tbh. 
Last time I tried to talk about this with my previous T she tried to get my gp involved which I didn’t want and it caused so much anxiety. She told me that she would keep it confidential if I could be certain to keep myself safe which I can but then she betrayed my trust anyway. It’s a way of coping to survive for me.
It has left me feeling like I shouldn’t be honest with my new T which isn’t fair to her in a way as I’m judging her on my previous T. 
I know that if I keep it to myself then I will never know if there are better ways of coping that work for me but I’m scared.

1jr9nu5,Not Sure Where To Vent Out. Tired.,"I haven't had a great childhood, my dad left us when I was 13 years old. My dad was never financially or emotionally available for us. So my mom starting working 2 shifts just to support us, I also started working at a young age so missed most of my colleague life. During my life, I have been lost most of the time and have tried cutting myself many times but never had the guts to cut deep enough to end myself. Though I use to pray that I die everyday, I always felt helpless and the fact no one understood me was even worst.

Though I haven't self-harmed for a couple of years now, I am still lost and tired of life that I still pray God ends me. I am making good money now, finance is not an issue but this money is worthless for me cause I am dying inside. I am married now, but my wife doesn't understand me and mostly just cribs and complains that I dont do enough but trust me I do everything I can. I am person who finds happiness in other peoples happiness, cause I don't know where to find happiness for myself.

I am not sure what to do just wanted a place to vent out. I never had a childhood, I never had teenage life I didn't spend a life most people I could see enjoying. I can't add everything here cause it will be huge post.

1jgzzx2,Why do I self-destruct?,"I tend to fall into bad habits whenever the stressors of life become unmanageable. I drink more, and I get very strong urges to self-harm. I drank tonight and I am fighting the desire to relapse (cut).

The thing is, I don't understand why this keeps happening. I have a long history of trauma and low self-esteem. My job involves a toxic work environment (not from my boss or anything, but from people I work around). They say horrible things about me. 

I have been seeing a therapist for two years, and we meet weekly. Sometimes waiting a week for a session feels much longer, because so much happens within a week. I have a lot on my mind, constantly. My therapist is really good at listening and understanding my problems, and she would want me to call her if I'm thinking about relapsing. I have called her for that reason. 

The thing is, I continue to do things that aren't good for me. I drink too much and I want to cut. Most days, I don't eat enough. I count calories and push myself to perform the best I can (my job requires physical activity), in hopes that I lose more weight. I want to be so thin that there is no fat. My therapist has called me out on losing weight, and people at work have also commented on it. It just makes me want to lose more. I want to see bones. 

...if I had to guess, I want a sense of control over my body. I want to starve it and cut it as much as I want to. People keep advising me against it, but I still want to do it. What's wrong with me? Why do i always self-destruct?

(id like to add that i had a few bad experiences with therapists in the past). im really scared of them leaving me, because this has happened many times in my life with people that were important to me.
this will be a very random thing to add, but had a really strong reaction on my mental health:
my partner made a tumblr account. i personally dont have tumblr so i wasnt really checking what they were posting. after a while (somewhere in february this year) i decided to check, and saw a lot of posts about their mutual, but these werent just normal-friend posts. they were calling eachother baby, their boyfriends, husbands, that they love eachother, how they wanna touch eachother😭? and yeah basically since that i cant survive a day without thinking about it, and everytime i think about it i cant breath properly and wanna throw up. they assured me multiple times that these were just jokes and nothing serious and i genuinely believe them, however its still stuck in my head at all times. i felt really felt out (i guess?) because of that, and the whole situation probably made my jealousy problem way worse.
i dont know what i expect posting this here, i hope someone can somehow understand me and help me with overcoming the fear of sharing this all to a therapist",2025-03-30 01:04:28,2,3,therapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1jmxhzu/i_get_too_jealous_over_people_in_my_partners_life/,get jealous people partners life,0.15,0.731,0.12,-0.9603,low
1jgcy9o,I’m feeling trapped and suffocated with my problems . And with life . How am I supposed to accept that,"Hi all, 

I’m trying to understand what acceptance really feels like. Does it mean becoming apathetic or not caring? I find it hard to stop caring—I care a lot, maybe too much. Can you care too much? And is acceptance something you actively choose, force, or does it just happen over time?

I’m struggling with acceptance in a situation that feels ongoing and unfixable. 

A example : living with chronic pain and tension everywhere , Crohn’s , IBS, reflux , anxiety and other host of symptoms I experience daily. There’s no clear solution. Western medicine has no solution- I know it can be resolved with alternative medicine , therapies etc but how long and how much more money? So many modalities and opinions and costs a lot of money , which I can’t afford now . I just graduated and I’m not rich . 

The extra pressure to hustle and get rich to afford health and wellness is even worse . 

Main issue in struggling urgently is : 

For example : My workplace has poor ergonomics, which worsens my pain and tension. I know what would help, but I can’t make the necessary changes because of restrictions, and it’s really frustrating. 

I’m doing things at home to manage, but going to work feels like it derails my progress.

I’m trying to understand: What does acceptance feel like in situations like this? Does it mean giving up on trying to change things? How do you accept something that continues to harm you?

I often feel trapped and resentful, and I’m wondering—does acceptance help with that, or does it only come once things are resolved?

Would love any insight—thank you.",2025-03-21 12:36:38,1,4,therapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1jgcy9o/im_feeling_trapped_and_suffocated_with_my/,im feeling trapped suffocated problems . life . supposed accept,0.189,0.63,0.181,-0.2534,moderate
1jjbcc8,i (22F) gave my boyfriend (21M) an ultimatum tonight,"i'm really worried i've gone about this all wrong.

we've been together about 7 months now, and the entire time his mental health has been on a steady decline. he's had a lot of deeply traumatizing experiences and has trouble managing his anxiety and bipolar disorder (including psychosis and severe depression). he self-medicates by constantly getting high and occasionally by drinking. he self-harms. he is on lexapro and abilify, but not in therapy, and until about a month ago i would briefly mention something like ""therapy could be really helpful for you!"" and he'd go ""haha maybe,"" but he was clearly not into the idea, so we wouldn't talk about it again for a while.

on our 6-month anniversary, i found out he'd been actively flirting with another girl who'd gotten his socials from a dating app (which is how he and i met). i was willing to forgive this, but told him in return i need him to seek therapy because his bad habits and tendency to not consider my feelings are really harming me. he sobbed (which he hadn't done in years) and said i was right, he'd get one. i even helped him find someone in-network with his insurance that might be a good fit for him. 

since then he's become closed off to the idea again, even getting defensive when i try to remind him. he has not reached out. in fact, they tried to reach out to him and he has all but refused to return their calls. his mental state has gotten even worse—the other night he drove slightly drunk to my house after work and when i told him that upset me, he felt so guilty he went home (still drunk) and has been wearing long sleeves since. you probably get the picture here.

the next morning, crying, i told him how hard on me it's been being his only source of support and especially after that ordeal it would mean the world to me if he made an appointment with the therapist we found. he clearly was unhappy with the request, but said he would do it. he did not. the next day he did not. today i asked him one more time and said if he's too anxious to make the call i would be happy to do it for him. he just kind of sat there and gave me no answer.

i texted him (i know, not ideal) after leaving his house today essentially saying that i've been too passive about it, and if there will be no hard feelings from me if he doesn't feel ready to go to therapy, but i'm not comfortable being in a relationship with someone who is just okay letting things get as bad as they're getting. it feels like he doesn't value me enough to try and improve things. but i said to him that i cannot stay if he doesn't at least TRY therapy because i have been so unhappy and it's affecting my ability to do literally anything. i told him call them tomorrow or i'm out. he said he feels forced but that he would call them tomorrow.

i'm regretting saying any of this to him. i really care about him and i want things to work—he tells me how lucky he is to have me and talks about wanting to marry me one day, and i feel like i generally treat him much better than what he's used to from women based on what he's told me. but i'm worried that i did the wrong thing getting so in his face about it. i felt like i didn't have a choice—it was that, continue swallowing my feelings (a habit i have worked very hard to break), or break up on the spot. i feel stuck. i don't even really trust he'll do it this time.

1jpym9y,Do I need to find a new therapist ?,"My therapist slipped up today in session . She was responding to something I had said and told me , “ That you ( I ) keep complaining about , excuse I mean you keep bringing  up . “ I heard it and didn’t say anything . But I was hurt . 

For context , I’ve been struggling with CPTSD symptoms along with good old depression and anxiety for the past three weeks .o was doing well after finishing up TMS and wanted to come back to work on other areas after getting some clarity . Now ,  I’ve basically hit a brick in therapy , because of all the systematic shit here in America . I’m stuck living in my childhood home and it’s the source of a lot of my symptoms , besides being very forking   BELOW the poverty line . 

She’s been trying to teach me skills I already know and have learned and use sometimes . I know that consistency is the key , however I feel like you can’t heal in the same place that has caused the harm . 

I’ve brought up this up to her and she’s told me that you can , by practicing skills .  I feel like when I push back or try , she pushes back and I just feel small and invalidated . 

I just feel like progress has stopped . I feel myself resenting her and being angry and annoyed . I feel she genuinely has my best interest at heart and don’t feel like she’s power tripping me .  I’m aware that it could be just more mental road blocks that brains put in place . 

I just don’t know what to do , because a huge ass part of this is my forking environment and being in a fascist country . I know those things to be true and they aren’t excuses . They ARE my reality . To me it feels like she sees me using them as excuses and avoidance . 

I just need Feedback , please . I want to make sure that I’m not the asshole here and I recognize my brain may be taking things out of context or my “ inner child  “ may be hijacking’s everything I’ve worked hard on . I also know you are only getting my half of the story .

1jslz4s,Does this make sense or am I delusional?  Wrote this a bit ago.,"There’s a kind of grief that doesn’t have a name.

It doesn’t come from death—not the kind anyone else would see—but it’s still a loss so complete, it guts you.

It’s the grief of realizing you were never the problem.

It’s the grief of waking up to the truth that the pain, the abuse, the abandonment, the silence, the violations—none of it was your fault.  
And it never was.  
And you believed it was.  
For decades.

I don’t know how to hold that.

I’ve spent my entire life building an identity around being the one who was too much, too sensitive, too needy, too broken. I learned to make it make sense by believing I caused it. That I deserved it. That if people left, it was because I gave them a reason to. That if I was hurt, it was because I provoked it. That if love didn’t stay, it was because I wasn’t lovable. That if someone died, it was because I wasn’t enough to stop it.

And now I’m standing here—somewhere between the life I survived and the truth I’m just beginning to let in—and it’s like the air’s been knocked out of me. Because if it wasn’t me… if I didn’t deserve it… then why? Why did no one stop it? Why did no one come? Why did they look at me and still walk away?

I want to scream. I want to break something. I want to curl up and sob for the girl who waited for someone to come and kept waiting, year after year, and no one ever did. The girl who made excuses for people who harmed her. The girl who kept asking, What’s wrong with me? when the question should have always been, How could they?

There’s rage. There’s sorrow. There’s something quieter, too—something that feels like betrayal, but not toward them. Toward myself. For not knowing. For not seeing it. For turning the knife inward over and over, thinking that would make me safer.

And then there’s the grief I didn’t even realize I was carrying—  
The grief for the life I never got to live.

What would I have been like if I had grown up with love?  
What if I had been wanted? Held when I cried? Told I was enough—without needing to prove it or shrink or apologize for existing?

Would I have let love in?

Would I have trusted people who offered me kindness instead of pushing them away before they could disappear?  
Would I have had a child—held them with everything I was never given and felt whole doing it?  
Would I have laughed more?  
Would I have danced without shame?  
Would I have known how to ask for help, or let myself fall apart in someone’s arms instead of always having to hold myself together?

Would someone actually care if I died?

And not just say it—mean it? Feel it like a rupture in their own chest? Would I be someone whose absence mattered?

I don’t think people understand what it costs to grow up believing your existence is a burden. What it takes to sit here now, in this body, at this age, and try to imagine a life where I was enough from the beginning.

I am grieving that version of me. The one who never got to be real. The one who lived inside me, quietly waiting, hoping maybe one day she’d be allowed to come out.  
I think she’s crying now.  
And I am too.

Because now I know:  
I didn’t ruin everything. I didn’t make people leave. I didn’t cause the pain. I didn’t deserve the silence or the violence or the shame.

I was a child.  
I was a child.  
I was a child.

And she deserved love. Not conditions. Not manipulation. Not fear. Not blame.  
Just love.

And I’m grieving her now. I’m grieving the safety she never had. The trust that was never built. The self-worth that never had a chance to take root.

I don’t know how to forgive the world for what it stole from her. I don’t know how to stop aching for the life she could have had. The person I could have been. The family I might have created. The connections that might have filled this hollow ache. The truth is, I don’t know who I would have become—but I know she would have been so beautiful.

Healing isn’t clean. It’s not a neat line from pain to peace. It’s blood and tears and shaking and silence. It’s mourning a life that never got to exist and trying to find enough reason to keep going in this one.

But I think maybe I’ve finally found a single thread of truth to hold onto, and I’m not letting it go:

It wasn’t my fault.

And somehow, that breaks me open and holds me together at the same time.  
Maybe for the first time ever.",2025-04-06 07:26:42,6,1,therapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1jslz4s/does_this_make_sense_or_am_i_delusional_wrote/,make sense delusional ? wrote bit ago .,0.154,0.737,0.108,-0.9898,unknown
1jmidg1,"I want to stop hating myself and I don’t know how because I’ve hated myself for over a decade (13 years, almost a decade and a half).","Basically the title says it all. It’s not that I don’t feel like I have a good reason to hate myself, I actually feel like I do. That’s entirely the problem because even though I can logically make it make sense, and there’s probably many people who’d agree with me that I do in fact have a good reason, I still just want to move on. I’m 25 years old now and am still stuck. I’ve thought about ending it all multiple times over that period (even thought I had an opportunity to do so when I had a package of 711 sleeping pills. Didn’t act on it though), self harmed, and intentionally sabotage relationships. Not just with friends, but family too. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t hardly leave my house except to go to work and get food/weed. I just… idk. I’ve lost my ability to actually cry, not because I can’t produce tears, but I just can’t bring myself to the point where I can just cry it out. I’ve got epilepsy and can’t seem to get a car ever in my life and thus since I live in a smaller city, have to rely on one of only a couple public transport systems, my mom, or my feet, and if I wanna do something other than go to a bar, Resturaunt/place-of-eating, or the park (which would just make me look like a weirdo), I have to rely on something with wheels and has a motor. I haven’t been able to hold down a decent job for more than a year before shit falls apart and I have to pick up the pieces. I’ve lived on my own since I was 18 and I’ve realized it’s probably the most unhealthy thing I’ve ever done. I know I need help but don’t have the strength/resources to ask for help. It doesn’t matter what kind of help it is. I’m independent to the point of self-destruction, suffer a nicotine addiction, and part of me doesn’t want help for any of it and hates my absolute guts for even thinking I deserve it, but another part knows exactly what’s going on and logically wants to act.

That’s another thing. I can’t seem to bring myself to do self care. I just don’t necessarily know how anymore I’ve become so emotionally numb after all this time. I’ve lost my sense of pride, especially in myself.

1jgjeqg,I tried a different therapist,"So I tried a different psychologist, and I can’t help but to compare her to my first psychologist. I need to rant. My first one was really amazing. She was able to calm me down. She validated my feelings with a non-judgmental approach. She immediately gets where I’m at. But maybe because she specializes in anxiety. I tried a different psych to hear other perspectives from an another professional because my 1st psych was unavailable. I don’t know who i am going to get then, they would just give me who on the spot. Within the first 10 minutes, I already want to leave the session. Maybe because she wasn’t ‘getting’ my intrusive thoughts and how disturbing they were (hocd, harm). She keeps saying that these thoughts are outside of OCD and more of identity (i’m not triggered dw). I mentally checked out on what she was saying because I guess I knew that we were just incompatible psych-client. No disrespect tho, the psych center have credible psychologist/psychiatrists all with Masters/Doctorate degree. I’m quite disappointed or dissatisfied. Feel like I just wasted my money. She was more of like a school counselor. Head straight to “try to talk your feelings to others and get insights from them.” She says that the self-harm part was also because of identity. Girl??????? Clearly, you’re not an anxiety specialist and IT SHOWS.

In the end, i just selectively chose what i need to hear and thats ‘acceptance’ and ride the wave. Yes, i am disappointed about the session.

1jqbx0n,How do i move on from an abusive relationship?,"TW: Abuse, Cutting, blood

2 years ago i moved across the the country to move in with my now ex.

Before i met her i was a completely different person. I was more positive and willing to see a lot of things through. I got out of a really long relationship before that and saw my mistakes and did everything i could to not make the same mistakes.

After the relationship i just feel voided. Not exactly nothing but something isnt right. Im not a happier person just more content, i dont go out as much and i dont contact my friends anymore.

Ever since dating her i felt as if i was some sort of chain on people. She told me before we broke up a lot of stuff she didnt like about me to my face (she was drinking) and it sort of stuck with me. She said she didnt love me before and that stuck too.

It makes me wonder if me simply being around is causing some kind of anguish for people and it hurts but i dont let it, if that makes sense.

Shes cheated on me, hit me and even harmed herself over small issues. She has BPD and i would try to get her to take her medication often even though sometimes she just wouldnt. She cut herself over the wifi and almost bled out in the bathroom and its a lot for a 22 year old.

Im 24 now and i dont feel healed. I get so scared of being in any relationship and even simple friendships are hard to get into now since im now always defensive. My guard is up, im always on social media now and i feel like ive gotten mean.

My job doesn't pay me enough for me to get therapy but i 100% know i need it but cant afford it. I want to figure out how to move on and live like i did before i met her. Now i feel as if im scared of everything and nothing at the same time and it feels physically crushing.

Last year I was in a rough spot I was self harming and my OCD and anxiety were very bad but now I feel okay for the most part. 

My therapist has been on maternity leave for several months and I haven’t my first appointment with her in quite some time. A lot of my anxiety was around sexuality and religion but I honestly haven’t been to church in a while and I haven’t been repressing those feelings as much and I haven’t felt too bad. Well I do feel confused though cause I don’t know where I stand religiously or politically any more. But any changes since then I feel embarrassed to talk with her about. 

I’ve maybe kinda been looking at more adult content which I know isn’t something she thinks is good for you and I just don’t know.

1jssllz,The echo response- unfortunate cycle of abuse,"This is something I’ve carried in silence for a long time—and I know I’m not the only one.

Many people who experience childhood sexual abuse struggle with a confusing, painful truth: their body responded. There was arousal. Maybe even pleasure. And because of that, they didn’t fight back. Or they hid what happened. Or they felt complicit.

But here’s the truth: bodily response is not consent. It’s biology. It doesn’t mean you wanted it. It doesn’t mean you’re guilty. And it doesn’t make the abuse any less real.

The shame around this part of abuse keeps people silent for years—even decades. Some survivors never tell anyone. Some go on to repeat patterns, act out what they learned, or even cross boundaries themselves… not out of evil, but because they were never given the tools to unlearn what was done to them.

I’m working on a framework that helps survivors (and professionals) understand this. Not to excuse harm—but to break the silence and stop the cycle.

I’m calling it (working title) The Echo Response Model, and it’s built on 5 parts:
	1.	Recognize – that abuse can include physical pleasure, and that’s still abuse
	2.	Validate – your response wasn’t your fault
	3.	Unlearn – behavior and beliefs picked up through trauma
	4.	Integrate – healing your nervous system, body, and identity
	5.	Restore – accountability, repair, and moving forward—whether as a survivor or someone who harmed

I’m sharing this here to see if others relate, and to invite anyone who’s interested in collaborating. Therapists, survivors, educators—whoever feels this is needed.

If this resonates with you, feel free to reply or DM. I’m planning to turn this into a full article and eventually a training/resource platform.

We need to be able to talk about this—without shame, without silence, and without losing our humanity.

1jq992e,I feel disgusted with myself whenever I look in the mirror,"TW:self harm and depression 
Over the last few months I’ve been hating myself. Every little mistake I messed up. I felt like every person I interacted with I was an issue or an inconvenience. My grades were decreasing really bad and my nightmares were messed up. Like they would be repeating my trauma over shootings or even losing all my friends. I hated myself so much at that time I started to SH myself and I regret it I’ve only done it twice but my brother found out and I think I traumatized him and I feel even more disgusted.That was two weeks ago. My friends also found out and they were concerned and worried



I already told my great grandma about the SH and told me I was gonna get help. When I tried to talk to my mom I didn’t tell her about what I did but I told her about my problems with nightmares. She acknowledged I have depression but she literally said after “But you do realize we all do right”. When she said 
that my heart sank. It felt like I was being heard but I the same time I couldn’t tell her so she wouldn’t understand. My mom is a good person who dose so much for me but I feel like I can’t talk to her about my mental health when we were in the car I told her about how I feel when I’m inside church and she said my emotions can sometimes lie to us and it kinda hurt. She told me we were gonna get help but I don’t trust her because when I had a traumatic experience she said we’re gonna get therapy but it been 3 years she tried bringing me to church but it went
 downhill.



Now I threw everything away but now I feel weird. I feel like I hurt so many people after I harmed myself and I hate myself even more. Even when I type this I feel sick in myself I’ve been lying to half of my family and friends and I feel like crying every night because I feel like it’s all partially my fault. My nightmares keep getting worst and I can’t sleep sometimes. Even today I had a dream that my mom and aunt found out about my cuts and they hugged me and told me it would be ok. But I refuse to believe that will happen it’s gonna go downhill if they found out. I hope that willI hope she gets me therapy but if she doesn’t I’ll just have to ask someone else.

never found myself inclined to harm myself in anyway and I never plan to but man my life is a bummer. never had a girlfriend except for an online one that barely counted. going to community college next year and everyone else around me is going to all these big universites, my sister is going to university and I'm not. I shouldn't compare myself to others but I'm surrounded by success while im embodied by guilt and failure. I had traumatic events happened when I was younger regarding a teacher. I knew what he was trying to do, to help me. He made me do multiple math tests alone on a computer and that made me feel horrible when I was younger. Its not the ordinary tramautic situation that everyone has but that shit hurt me the most knowing that I'm different than everyone else. Never payed too much attention in school as I think I have undiagnosed ADHD. Its so hard for me to sit in a calculus class and pay attention. My mind is always somewhere else, thinking about my two week phase of whatever random topic I'm focusing on. Other people have it worse I know, I just need to get this out as Ive never talked to anyone about this just because I'm the “funny” guy in the group and I always gotta smile. I just want a normal paying job and do normal things which is fine by me. I'm quite ugly as well. I mean that's what everyone says behind and in front of me as well. I'm not fat, my hair isn't greasy. Its just the way I look. It sucks but that's not very important. In conclusion, I've got all these people around me that support me and I've got a caring mother and father that fight from time to time but I don't feel fulfilled.

1jg6y9k,"Please help! Why do I sometimes feel this intense sense of guilt, like I’ve done something unforgivable in the past and never atoned for it?","


Sometimes I will feel a terrible sense of guilt and shame, like I’ve done something reprehensible and don’t deserve to be where I am in life. Or like I deserve to have it worse to atone for something unforgivable I did as a child. I have no idea what it would be, but sometimes I feel like I did something so terrible like I killed someone accidentally and got away with it. I would never want to kill anyone, and have literally never felt inclined to do harm onto other people or animals or anything. but sometimes I feel like I already did, but i have no idea why, but feeling this way makes me wonder if I actually did. Occasionally I’ll have dreams that I killed someone and I wake up feeling extremely shameful, and like I deserve to be punished. I have a lot of weird dreams, but these dreams are the worst because they make me wonder if i actually did it and I can’t recall it, and the memory only remains in my subconscious.

When I was younger I was very emotional and sensitive, and sometimes impulsive, so I would act without thinking. I remember trying to slap someone in elementary school but missed, I once through fake money at another girl and caused her to cry, One time I pushed my best friend onto the floor because I was mad at her and made her cry. I feel disgusted with myself when I think about some of the things I’ve done as a child, and I’m 18 now. I wasn’t one of those kids that always got in trouble and disturbed the class though. I was a good student in elementary and always had good grades. Most of the time I was considerate to others and even went out of my way to do acts of kindness without needing to. I had friends and was normal, but then I also had these moments of impulsivity and hurt others without thinking, and I don’t know why I’d ever do that. I feel like I might’ve done worse things that I can’t remember but I’m not sure if this is true.

And I feel like I’ll pay for it in the future, like something terrible will happen to me. Did I actually do something terrible and can’t remember it, or is my brain exaggerating all of this? Where is this coming from? Is it because I’m taking my life for granted and not living my life how I should be and want to be, so I feel guilty but it’s manifesting in this distorted way? Ive had these feelings arise every now and then all throughout my life, like I’ve done something absolutely vile and I’m actually a terrible and evil person.

Sometimes I fantasize about harming myself just enough to be absent for a few weeks or days so I can have an excuse as to why I can't keep up with my studies. But I've never attempted. I'm too scared. I wanna tell my friends but I'm too ashamed since most of them are having a harder time than me. I'm very privileged to have my parents pay for everything and to have a new house just for me to be closer to school, which makes me more guilty about how I'm acting. I don't think I deserve to cry or feel such stress or sorrows because I don't even try to study or anything.

I've actually started feeling this unmotivated right after the pandemic happened. I used to be an honor student(from grade1-grade10) but then the pandemic happened and I got burned out. The adjustment period was harsh during g11. Since I was one lf those ""naturally smart/gifted kids"" I never really learned how to study properly. So when I got into a very academically inclined school, I felt very dumb because I think that time during the pandemic kind of fried my brain a little. I don't absorb info that easily anymore and I forget things faster. It made me feel horrible and I just went further down.

This worsened during college. I could not keep up with my classmates at all. Even though some were the same with me(failing scores and all) they were still trying(studying). Meanwhile I could not get motivated to do anything with my life at all. I've thought about other college programs but none of what I want to do provides financial stability (atleast not a large percentage) and I'm too scared(?) to tell anyone especially my parents since they've asked me multiple times already if I want to go into dentistry. My parents aren't the type to get very angry or hold grudges when it comes to things like this(my sister stopped law school and they never got mad). But I'm just scared to say anything because even if I wanted to quit, I've literally got nothing else. Idk what to do with my life. And I hate myself for crying cause from others, my problems seem very trivial(even for me actually).",2025-03-24 19:29:53,3,0,therapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1jiuwqw/im_very_unmotivated_and_idk_what_to_do_with_my/,im unmotivated idk life . im .,0.158,0.779,0.062,-0.9959,moderate
1j59fko,Why does it feel like my emotions are everywhere?,"Hi I'm a teenager and I'm just trying to see if this is like a problem or if it's nothing to stress over. I'll probably just list what is going on.

So first, when I am at school or just hanging out with my friends I have a sense that I am just there with no care, like with no emotion, yet I do feel a slight amount periodically. Even when I laugh sometimes it's a little more forced, sure the moment may be funny but I make it sound like the funniest thing ever. I smile with my friends and joke around online but half the time I feel nothing especially in person.

Next, when I am at home I like to stay in my room, separated from my family, I don't know why maybe it's a safe place but all I know is that I feel normal when I'm alone in my room yet the moment I come out, I feel completely different, any menial task will make me shake with anger for no reason and I feel a distinct hatred towards so many of the things my parents do. Like I'm just nitpicking them like pasta again or thinking how they do the same things over and over with no interest. I feel I'm the only one I'm my family who is not just boring.

Next, no matter where I go, if I find a song good, I will feel exactly like it for no reason. Like I'm listening to an upbeat sing and i feel like everything is great and the goal of life is to live with sillyness. Then the next one will probably make me feel like life is nothing. It's probably not that big of a deal but it just freaks me out how fast and sudden my ideals change by just listening to a song for like 15 seconds.

Next, I know I said before that I feel nothing sometimes or a lot of the time yet it has actually been horrible how bad it is. When my grandpa died last year I didn't cry. Sure I didn't know him much as he lived in another country yet I felt nothing I acted like I felt something when all I could do was think of what a horrible person I am. Even when I was about 8 I remember going to my grandma's funeral and not shedding a tear and I played with my cousin in a coloring book while the eulogy was given. I feel horrible now knowing hiw my parents must have felt.

Next, I have multiple symptoms of depression yet I don't feel that distinct sadness I've heard people describe it as.

Next, I feel like I'm pondering my feelings a but to much. Just today I said in my head with an upbeat voice ""you know I will see how long I can go with putting on a fake smile and not showing anything real."" Like now looking back at that it makes me feel like I'm going to enjoy the sadness and trauma of bottled feelings and I just don't know why. I'm not grasping for pity yet I'm still doing this. Not because I think it's the norm but because it's what my body wants.

Next, though I already mentioned I have to emphasize the actually change when I into my household. Any chores I am asked make me want to yell and scream. This is also new as before I would actually help and there would be no problem.

Next, I recently started listening to a new artist, incredible music but a lot of his music is about sadness, rejections, depression and things that scarily relate to me. I have never been in a relationship so there is no heartbreak. Yet his music even the ones about sensitive topics strangly relate to me and comfort me in a way that feels right yet just feels wrong in some way to put in a emotion relief playlist.

Next, for some reason my mind is trying to find out why I am acting like this, recently I found myself playing certain music to see how I would react and seriously started to think to take notes. It's just insane that my internal monologue is trying to be like a detective and figure out exactly what is wrong. I will try to zone out in class try and automatically control my random ideals. Like a superpower to change from depressed to knowing what the meaning of life is. Every thought I have is carefully analyzed by my own mind just trying to grasp for answers. Which the things I have written so far are all I have found out. 

Next, my parents have been fighting my whole life, not physically but verbally they keep yelling and it feels like they only get along when food or messing with us is involved. Over the year I have ignored it more.and mor until now all it really is, is just annoying. My parents also thretans to take my things away sometimes yet I just brush it off, like scarily nonchalantly.

Lastly, sometimes I feel like all these things at once and other times I feel perfectly fine yet I guess typing this is helping suppress it A little bit. Right now I feel fine yet maybe tommarow I'll be truely depressed or will be the biggest optimist ever. Right now I feel as if there is nothing wrong and I'm just typing to get pity yet just an hour ago I was shaking from rage when my dad tried to ask me help him downstairs. I will randomly think about a bunch of things without being able to stop no matter how much self control I have. My emotions are everywhere and I don't know If it's just hormones or if I got something but it's safe to say that I feel like I'm the same on the outside and on the inside I have split personality disorder going on while still knowing everything that happens.

By the way I am not stressed about academics except for when i fail something which I'll have a short cry session mentally.


If you actually read till the end of this then thank you, this just is nice to have a place where I now know I can say something without worry. I'm sorry if there are grammatical and spelling mistakes I just speed typed this to get everything down. I just posted this because no one has a similar situation or at least I could find. Anyways, thank you for listening to me rant, please give any advice you can it will help me a lot. And one last thing though I sometimes have self harm thoughts I will never actually do them no matter what I feel, that is crossing a line I will never commit to them, that will be the only thing I forget.",2025-03-07 02:29:28,2,2,therapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1j59fko/why_does_it_feel_like_my_emotions_are_everywhere/,feel like emotions everywhere ?,0.13,0.73,0.14,0.7393,moderate
1jaav8j,What causes compulsive lying? How can I stop?,"Posted this on another subreddit but it got removed.

A couple months ago I was in a bad mental state and I just started lying about everything. Even really random stuff that didn’t even make sense. I lied about having a Jewish friend and made an alternate account for this ‘friend’ where I would talk to myself and often tease each other about religion. Like, why? What was the point of that? Why did I do that? I used to also complain about what this fake friend said. I lied about other stuff too, like having taken antidepressants and looking different than what I said. I feel awful for lying about stuff like this. I also lied about my age not long ago, saying I was 19 when I was 16, which I’ve stopped now because I know how harmful that can be as older people were flirting with me and I didn’t know how to respond.

I’ve always had the urge to compulsively lie about random things for no reason and I’m trying to stop because it’s messing me up. I think I’m just paranoid about people knowing who I really am so I make up things that can deter people from the real me. Dude I’m so messed up and it makes me cry and worry with stress because why did I think doing any of that stuff is okay? Like I’m lying about genuinely terrible stuff and potentially messing up my life and those around me. I don’t want to be like this anymore. I’m seeing a therapist soon because I don’t want to be like this anymore. I’ve always had mental health issues and a couple of months ago it declined to where I didn’t even care about what I said anymore and was saying some really harmful stuff and getting people really worried about me because I wanted attention and was probably a cry for help. I regret it so much. I want to be a better person.

Like I lied about so much stuff. I didn’t even feel like me, more like I was playing a character. Everything I said was fake, even my name and where I lived. I think it was a mix of attention seeking and paranoia about people finding out who I am. I just don’t think I’m very mentally mature either and I’m quite impulsive.

My only saving grace is the fact I have a therapist now. I hope they can help me become better.

1j9g0hd,"Conflicted between two ex-girlfriends( 24F and 26F), both important in different ways. How to deal with this?","I (M26) have been in complicated relationships and I’m feeling torn between two women from my past. I’d really appreciate some advice on what I should do moving forward.

The First Relationship - Priya 24F (Tamil, different religion)

I started dating Priya in 2020. We were together for around two years until August 2022. Priya is from a traditional family, and her parents were against our relationship because of the religious differences. She was very shy, especially when it came to intimacy, and we didn’t have much of a sexual relationship. She never told anyone about us, which made me feel like I was kept in the shadows. Eventually, due to family pressure, we broke up in August 2022, but it wasn’t particularly hard for me because I had already started moving on by then.

The Second Relationship - Samantha 26F (same religion)

After Priya, I met Samantha in late 2022. We hit it off immediately. Our relationship was very romantic and passionate, and I felt loved and wanted. Samantha’s family was also supportive of our relationship, and we had a healthy sexual life. However, in December 2022, Priya found out about Samantha and came back, asking if we could try again. I said no because I was already deeply involved with Samantha. That was a hard moment for me, as I felt bad for Priya, but I was happy with Samantha. I spent more time with Samantha, and things felt really good for a while.

The Breakup with Samantha

In December 2023, Samantha went to a concert without informing me, and I got really upset. I shouted at her, and this led to her feeling heartbroken and questioning our future. We tried going to therapy, but it didn’t work. Eventually, Samantha decided to end the relationship. I was devastated, almost to the point of self-harm, but eventually, I started to heal. To help me forget Samantha, I reconnected with Priya, and we started dating again in early 2024.

Reconnecting with Samantha

In June 2024, Samantha reached out again, apologizing for everything, but I didn’t get back together with her. She didn’t know I was dating Priya at the time. I thought Samantha had moved on, but in March 2025, she contacted me, saying she missed the physical connection we shared. We ended up sexting, and it felt like things were back to how they were before. We met at a mutual friend’s funeral, and we ended up having sex. It felt intense, and I still crave her physically, even though I know Priya is more beautiful.

Now, Samantha wants to get back together, and she’s even willing to wait for me for as long as 10 years. She’s open to the physical side of things too, which matches my desires, but I feel like I’m cheating on Priya. Priya, on the other hand, always tells me I need to achieve more before marriage and that I have to prove myself to her parents.

The Dilemma

I’m deeply conflicted. On one hand, I feel this strong connection with Samantha, and we’re very physically compatible. She’s ready for marriage and wants to commit to me. On the other hand, I’m with Priya, and while I know she loves me, there’s a lot of pressure from her family, and I feel like I’m not measuring up to what she expects. I feel guilty because, even though I’m with Priya, I’m still emotionally and physically drawn to Samantha. I don’t want to hurt either of them, but I feel like I’m already doing that by being with Priya while still seeing Samantha in secret.

Questions:

1. How do I choose between these two women, who both mean so much to me in different ways.

2. I don't wanna hurt Priya, I feel guilty for her. Im afraid she might hurt herself 


Thanks for your help and advice!

1j8zrnb,"I fell back in it (gambling), but I can't get the trigger out of my head","I'm sorry, this is going to be a long post.... but I can't anymore, I don't know to who to talk to

I need advice, some real advice because apparently I can't afford it right now, and I'm hoping someone can help me out here I'm 25 and I initially got into gambling as self harm, literally, was having a depressing moment in my previous relationship, and got down to cutting myself, punishing myself in other harmful ways one of which was throwing away money, in ""there you go gifts"", trading and gambling. Luckily got out of it, went to a therapist and managed to break up the toxic relationship (for both of us). I started recovering, and one hard part was the financial one since I got myself into debt, bad debt. I felt really bad about it and ashamed, so much that I couldn't tell anyone not even my parents.

The fact that I had to hide it, meant that I couldn't show any financial problems, and that's what led me to gamble even more to get back to 0 so that no one had to know about it. It started off gambling the part of my salary that I really meant to ""save"", I thought that sometime in the future I would hit the big luck and get back to 0, so the issue there is that I lived on a budget. I think the real issue came when I got into a new relationship, guys I don't know how to tell you, I wasn't looking for a relationship, but this girl changed my perspective, I fell in love so hard.

We've been together 8 months now, and things are starting to get serious, and I've been shit gambling to the point I felt sick, to the point I felt exhausted, to the point I had effing nightmares about those dealing cards, slots or whatever. I had to come out to my parents because I couldn't pay the month and I wanted to come clean. That's when they helped me out, I never expected anything from them and now they've lent me around 17k to save me. The money they lent me was also in collaboration with my grandparents to which I'm giving back part of them monthly. My salary is 2.4k a month and I'm giving them 500 euros a month. Plus 400 a month go away to a f\*\*\* bad decision of buying a stupid brand new car (this was even before the gambling). I have some other debt installments I'm still paying, so basically I had 1300 euros a month coming in my bank account clean (to which I had to add some necessary other expenses like gas, medical etc.). I felt ashamed of myself, I felt like I was a shit person, I really wanted to disappear from earth. Anyways I broke my parents trust and they demanded access to my bank account which I gave them.  
At this point I wanted to be financially responsible since up until then I was spending everything in trips with my GF (ofc she didn't know anything about it), and I did offer the biggest part of it since she's younger (20) and still doesn't work. That's when I told her that I got into trouble gambling in the past and now I was paying back my parents, and I didn't feel good about not feeling financially irresponsible, and that I had to start being on a budget. She was totally understanding of it, and really supported me in the decision, even though I didn't really tell her the gravity of it.

This is where all the pressure came in:

\- Then insecurities kicked in, we started talking about renting a possible place and splitting it in two (her half would have been payed by her parents), I loved the idea but I wanted to get out of my debt with my parents.

\- My parents kept checking my bank account and saying that I would have 300 a month and the rest would've gone to them, I would have only a prepaid card. I wanted to get out of the controlling thing and give them back everything to be free

\- Social media showed the average guy that is financially free, I wanted to feel like that, I wanted to feel normal for once, get back everything and exclude myself from all gambling sites, and just be f\*\*\*\* happy

On top of this, the betting site I lost the money on had gradual cash backs, monthly bonuses because of the loyalty program I got into (yes funny, really funny), so I never actually stopped, I just was getting that 100/200 euros a month from the betting site using the aforementioned, just without depositing. I never felt the need to deposit, I was just chilling, except I wasn't I guess, because...

This lead to something really bad, it lead me to loosing probably 30k. 30 f\*\*\*\*\* K in two months, TWO MONTHS. Asked 2, maxed out 2 credit cards, and now I find myself negative 6k with a net salary (after new installments of the 2 new loans) of 900 euros. That's right. I just wanted to be a normal person and now I got myself into real trouble. I don't want to tell my parents, I changed my bank account password, to which of course they're asking questions but do not doubt too much since I seemed to be out of it for some months. I feel the need to say it to my girlfriend, say that I've ruined everything, say that the guy that she thought was sweet, mature, romantic, brings her flowers every week because he can't stop thinking about her, the guy who she has so much fun with, her best friend, is a total fraud. TOTAL FRAUD. She's everything to me, it's the first person that made me think of a future family, I always thought about career and nothing else. Well anyways, I don't know what to do now. for sure I'm going to take the L and keep the negative balance and build it back up gradually. I know I can do it, but I don't know if I can sustain the pressure of showing to my parents I'm a good guy and to my girlfriend that I'm just as normal as the other guys. That's what brought me back to it.

I'm so pissed to myself, I just want to slap myself so much. SO MUCH. I feel a fraud, I am a fraud, and I don't think anyone should trust me, yet I want other people to trust me, I don't want to be told by my parents that I'm a fraud or be dumped by my girlfriend. Anyways I need to tell her because this way I'm not even giving her the option to choose with who to actually build a future with, she can't waste her time on me not knowing the fraud I am.

I was a great guy, have friends, studied financial investments (was investing long term in stocks), have a great job, ambitious, still studying college because I care about the degree, have a beautiful girlfriend, good parents, have fitness goals morning runs and hitting the gym.

1jdgzxp,Psychodynamic,"
I started psychodynamic therapy 3 months ago (currently at session #12).

When I started the therapy I was in a panic mode, scared and barely able to function.

Being self aware of the ongoing emotional neglect from both of my parents and not being close to any of my siblings cause they are also emotionally not aware is so painful. The feelings of profound loneliness and social anxiety are just awful and I cannot accept it anymore but the stress that comes with it is so difficult like I feel the stress in my body.

The vulnerable version of me is difficult and it brings a lot of anxiety and physical symptoms with it and at the same time I can no longer accept the emotionally numb version of myself because it just makes me feel angry and frustrated.

It is like I switch between these two versions of myself the one that brings overwhelming emotions and the other that numb them and feel angry instead. I just feel afraid that all this emotional stress will harm me physically by getting a disease or something.

How was your experience with psychodynamic? I feel like regardless of how overwhelming this vulnerable version of me is something about it feels right as I can no longer handle the emotional numbness and random anger and frustration I felt for years.",2025-03-17 19:34:06,1,0,therapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1jdgzxp/psychodynamic/,psychodynamic,0.289,0.658,0.053,-0.9967,low

1jcyo15,Absent mindedly prepared for self harm - don’t know what to do,"So I wanted to start this by saying I’ve been clean from c//tting as a self harm tool for years now, I don’t know the exact time frame and quite frankly I’m not bothered about that but the point is I haven’t c//t myself for years. I stopped because my parents found out and I couldn’t bare to see them see more fresh scars so I stopped out of fear and then I’ve not touched a blade in that way, minus the brief period of relapse shortly after without visible scars on my leg. 

I’m scared, because usually when I’ve had thoughts of c//tting myself they’ve been momentary, I know they’ll pass, just the urge gets strong. Except the urge isn’t strong right now in this period of time, it’s come up a few times right before panic attacks but the planning, the made up scenarios of what would happen if I do do it have happened. Like intrusive thoughts except… I lean into them. It’s like I’m mentally preparing myself to get worse and need this tool again. Because the truth is, my mental health is shit again, the shittiest it has been since school, I opened up something inside of me and suddenly all this repressed anxiety has just made its way to the top and I don’t know what to do except actually deal with it because I can’t suppress it again, I want to get better. I’m receiving therapy so I CAN get better. 

People at my work know about my anxiety right now, I’ve been trying to tell as many people as I can about my mental health so that they can support me so that it’s easier to look after myself. Even the store manager knows right now (she’s been super supportive and I really trust her). But fuck can they find out about these thoughts. There’s only one person I’d potentially trust with this information because she’s young but old enough that she’s more recovered from her anxiety, but I don’t want to worry her with this information and she is a supervisor despite the fact she’s very friendly with me and I worry that even mentioning something like this to her she’d have the duty to report it. I worry people will think I’m a danger to myself but right now I’m not, that’s the thing, I’m just growing increasingly worried that it’ll only be a matter of time until I will be. How much anxiety and pain and suffering do I have to endure again to feel like I need to relapse to cope? Because everything is getting more serious, what was just more panic attacks and more anxiety has mentally drained me over the past few weeks and made me more actively process the trauma I’ve been through because ultimately, that is the root reason as to why I’m doing this shit right now.

I’m scared though. I keep saying these are just thoughts and it doesn’t mean I’ll do anything but I have a blade in my bag. It’s from my past job, a box cutter, I need to get rid of it but idk how and where. And this is so stupid of me but I just picked it up and looked at it and I pressed my finger on the blade part and then really pressed down just to see how easily it COULD cut, and yes it’s very blunt but I figured with enough force and pressure it could do harm. I don’t know why I did it, I didn’t draw blood on my finger cause it wasn’t the attempt of self harm it was just seeing how easy or hard it would be to use and now I feel like an idiot and more of a danger to myself than I was because why would I absent mindedly do something like that? If I do that with barely any thought then what’s stopping me from making the first mark again? Then what? 

My partner doesn’t even know I’ve had these thoughts and considerations, they’ve heard when I’ve had urges but nothing this serious because they know about my anxiety and if they know I’ve had these thoughts it’ll break them. I’m seeing them tomorrow and staying over theirs for a few nights and I don’t know what to do because what if I have these thoughts there? I don’t know how to tell them that I might not be able to keep myself safe come a few more weeks when I might have had enough…",2025-03-17 02:18:54,1,1,mentalillness,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1jcyo15/absent_mindedly_prepared_for_self_harm_dont_know/,absent mindedly prepared self harm dont know,0.161,0.729,0.11,-0.995,low

1jcwl43,"I need help. I don’t know If I’m going crazy or something. (Includes more then self harm, under 14 yrs)","In school, I often lock myself in bathroom during break time with my computer In hand and just search for “how to kill myself painlessly in the school’s bathroom” or etc. but since very website is blocked, I either choke myself until I cough out my saliva or dig my nails in my neck. I often experience social anxiety and can’t even continue a normal conversation or answer a question in front of the whole class when called out. What’s worse is that, I naturally have an angry/glaring face to the others and that made it even harder for me to communicate with someone, it’s really beginning to take a toll on my life from not being to speak my native language sometimes, or not being able to speak anything at all. If I need to do a presentation in front of the whole school/class, I’ll begin sweating, shaking, and even crying if I have to speak more sentences while stuttering. Of course. because I’m Asian, my parents will never notice my social anxiety and thinks I’m just being bratty/refusing to talk unless given satisfaction/etc. I begun isolating myself more and more the years go by, eventually even ignoring my childhood friend for a while due to presenting a speech to the whole school for a few times which made me nervous/scared/anxious/crying all the weekend. I’m not able to go to a therapist because of how young I am and my parents not knowing/understanding, I’m scared I won’t even be able to make it/continue middle school before I kill myself at home or the bathroom stalls at school. Is there anything I could do to make it better without having to see a therapist/etc?

1jj09w8,I might be a pedo im 15,"(NSFW MIGHT BE TRIGGERING 🚩🚩🚩) 
Im 15f and keep on having horrible thoughts about young kids. My worrying thoughts started when I was 11 which is known to be the onset age of pedophilia. I also have thoughts about being racist, misogynist and gay (I have nothing against gay people,) and I have body dysmorphia. I stopped going to real life school and I home educate now. My thoughts don’t sound like OCD, I’ll have thoughts like “that one’s hot” “that one isnt” (like picking or choosing.) I avoid watching kids on TV in case it triggers me. I have told my parents that I have strange thoughts and I’m worried that I’ll act on them. I said promise that you won’t let me do anything. I once called a *victim* helpline (I was desperate) and I said that Im worried about myself and they said we’ll have to report this, I was 12 and nothing has happened yet.. I know the whole prospect of OCD is that it’s “ego systonic,” or not true to the person’s values or beliefs, but I don’t know what is true anymore! My head tells me that it is my values. People with OCD describe the thoughts as disgusting but truthfully I don’t know how I feel about them. I had a chat with my dad and I said that the thoughts won’t stop, I feel like a ticking time bomb and that I don’t know whether I enjoy them or not. He said you’re crying so you obviously don’t. My head says this; “you enjoy them. You’re lying to yourself. Stop trying to be a nice person” anyway this has been tearing me apart. I will never harm anyone and if I ever feel tempted I will ask to be institutionalised, I was when I was 13 but it was because I had had enough. I love Michael Jackson’s music, and I feel like if I actually had OCD I would refuse to listen to him, as the evidence does NOT stack in his favour. But I keep on listening - I never listen to artists who have been proven guilty like Drake. Im terrified to tell my parents exactly *what* I worry about because understandably they hate pedos and I do too. I just feel like I couldn’t live a guilt free life if I was diagnosed as a pedo. I feel so awful ☹️",2025-03-24 23:00:24,9,49,mentalillness,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1jj09w8/i_might_be_a_pedo_im_15/,might pedo im,0.149,0.723,0.128,-0.8047,unknown
1j8mb9v,I want to breakup with my boyfriend because he hasn't gone through any hardship in life,"This is my first relationship and my bf's first real relationship even though he's had one ex. My bf is  loyal, confident, affectionate, fun person. He would never do anything to harm me, respects me, wouldn't push for anything physical which I'm not comfortable with and he also wants to be in a committed relationship. The problem is I have gone through some issues in my life and some ongoing, I have OCD, PMDD gone through some surgeries for my uterus and have painful periods cramps. My bf on the other hand has had a easier life and he doesn't really do well in stressful situations, a small thing like minor fight with a random person in street would make his mood godown and small physical injuries also would hurt him a lot. Even in our relationship, if we fight or have an argument he can't really handle it and he says it's fucks his mood up and he's sensitive like that. He wants to have a lots of fun and would avoid anything that's uncomfortable or stressful even at the slightest. He has himself said he is not emotionally mature. He also has listening problems like he won't listen fully to you and would often cut you off even though he has worked on that problem and has come so far for me. I mask my mental health struggle so well and I often felt alone and unheard in this relationship and I asked him to check up on me now and then and he does that and he tells me I can talk to him and open up but the times I did I never felt understood and I feel like he's doing it just bc I have asked him to. The main problem here for me is, if he has not faced any life challenge and trust me I come with challenges like mental ups and downs and physical struggles I need some support, how will he be there for me when I need him? I need an emotionally mature, understanding and listening man to be with so he can see that I'm struggling and is there for me.

1jnrjvj,How do I get started on my journey to becoming mentally healthy?,"Well what can I say. I have been struggling with my mental health for years. And it is hard for me to talk about it, because I am a man. I know that people have to deal with far worse demons than I have to. I would say that I somewhat have my life together and I somewhat feel strong. Still there is that other side of me that comes out every now and then. Sometimes more regularly sometimes less. That side that absolutely despises itself. That side that pities itself, because it cannot help but feel defeated. 

And I am in a weird position. Because I usually gaslight myself into thinking that everything is fine and I just need to stop being a b\*\*ch. Especially when I am in a good state I feel ashamed of ever thinking that I would have some kind of mental illness.

But I do know that something just is not right. Over the years I have only engaged in self-harm 3-4 times and never majorly. But the point is, I did engage in it and I don't think a healthy person would do so. At the moment I also do not see myself in danger of taking my own life, but I did have my thoughts and fantasies about it.

I know that the first step of taking ownership about my mental health is talking to a professional. And I already made an effort. I called the doctor's office last month and am currently waiting for a call-back, which can take a while since they have a lot to do.

But I would like to know what can I do in the meantime to get a better grasp on the topic of mental health and whats going on inside of me right now? Do you have any tips, book recommendations, etc.?

1jodbp3,I am recovering from mental illness but it's extremely bumpy. Is this normal?,"I am two months clean from self-harm. Something that is really triggering me is gaining weight back now that I am eating regularly again. I used to barely eat, and when I did I would make myself throw it back up again. I dont know if I would call it an eating disorder because it was never diagnosed, but I have started gaining back the weight that I lost, and I constantly beat myself up about it.

1ji2ij0,Am I in a simulation?,"My life is all mental agony. So many coincidences seem to happen, so many random thoughts put into my head while just as many or taken. I don’t feel real, at least a lot of the time. I feel like cutting off my fingers because it might show me something deeper. Like maybe it will bring me back or something like that, just not floating away. I just feel like the repetition in my life exceeds the normal, time doesn’t seem equal, I don’t have a cycle I live in, it’s like I’m rolling around in tube while others are strapped in. Time used to be the way I went through life to ground me, but it’s not even able to anymore, It doesn’t feel real, time doesn’t feel right. 

That is why I’m starting to think that maybe this is all a simulation, or just a lie. Maybe I’m not even me, maybe I am in a coma and I’ve created this reality to stay sane, but I’ve been in it so long I’m not keeping it together. Or maybe I’m waking up and that’s why I’m out of touch. 

I laugh at nothing, just sitting in a chair and will randomly start laughing. I don’t know who I am, or what life is. I have a set of morals, but every so often I switch, it’s like I do a full 180. Everything is then different, it’s like I’m a new person, like a completely different person who would have different friends. It’s my secondary state luckily, because it’s the more violent and hateful of the 2 possibly 3 of me. I’m already full of hate and rage, but it’s just a supercharged on that secondary version of me.

To keep it short and simple my girlfriend might get admitted to a mental hospital and I have so many unanswered questions I really need answered. She’s 16 (so am I) but idk if being a minor changes anything but if it does then please let me know cause google just gives me long paragraphs abt nothing I’m looking for. 

Here are my main questions. 

TIME WINDOW/PERIOD? 
What’s the usual time window someone’s there? She didn’t try and harm herself she just has horrible mental health and her therapist is why she’s going. She is a minor if that changes anything. 

CONTACT?
Any way to visit or contact her at all? She called me before her phone got taken by the hospital and she said she has my number written down but that’s all I know. 

Here’s a question that I don’t really mind if people know or not but everything helps! 

WITHDRAWS?
She smokes nicotine and weed and I was wondering if they did anything? Obv not handing her a cigarette and a lighter but do they give any medicine to calm them down? Her withdrawals are gonna be hell for her and I feel horrible. 



She still isn’t admitted yet I think, idk cause we have no contact, but if she’s not admitted and I get confirmation and all that I will be sure to add it to this post. Thanks to everyone who took their time to read this and if anyone knows ANYTHING, doesent have to be anything i asked but ANYTHING please let me know, I want all the info about this place as I can get, Thank you. stay strong and I love y’all! ❤️❤️

1jflc5c,7 years of isolation amde me hate humans,"I wrote this in Arabic first, but here is the English translation:

From the age of 18 to 25, the number of friends I spent my youth with and shared the most important moments of my life with is literally the most depressing number in existence: zero. Since I graduated high school, every attempt to experience any form of human connection has only resulted in failure, embarrassment, and shame. I wouldn’t even mind if my relationship with someone was full of drama and problems—I just want to feel like I still exist. These past seven years have not been easy. At first, I felt a bit of hope, but it quickly turned into panic, fear, and constant rejection from people. I ended up completely alone with my thoughts.

When intrusive thoughts hit me, making me feel like something bad is about to happen—like a heaviness in my hands that makes me unable to lift them, weakness in my legs, or my heart beating too fast—I start thinking these are all symptoms of a heart attack. Literally, everything in me and everything I see around me becomes a reminder that I’m about to die, and there’s nothing or no one to take that fear away from me. And it’s not just about death. It’s also about losing my sight, my hearing, spinal injuries, and so much more. Every single thought that enters my mind forces itself into my reality, and with no one around, there’s no one to reassure me that I’m just imagining things.


These fears inevitably forced me to find a way to cope and reduce their intensity. And what was the only way I found to lessen these obsessive thoughts and fears for seven years—and still rely on today? The only thing that relieved me, even a little, was putting on my headphones, playing music, pacing back and forth in my room, and imagining people talking to me. I would physically react, talk to myself, laugh, feel sad, get angry, cry, and experience every emotion I’ve been deprived of. Most of the time, these imaginary conversations weren’t even related to my intrusive thoughts at all. Just imagining another person engaging with me—even about random topics—somehow made me feel a little comforted.


I feel like I’m missing any presence of another being in my life. What hurts me even more is that one time, I was walking on the sidewalk, and two people were walking toward me, shoulder to shoulder. One of them needed to step back so we could all pass without bumping into each other. But to my surprise, neither of them moved aside, and my shoulder collided hard with one of theirs. The strange thing is, I didn’t get angry or upset at all. On the contrary, my first thought was that I hadn’t felt another human being in so long. Any touch, even a random bump or an accidental hit—I don’t mind. Just anything that reminds me that I still exist in this world. The feeling that no one knows me isn’t just about ""no one knows me."" It feels like I’ve been exiled from existence itself.
Why haven’t I been able to form any real human connection to this day? Why have I been deprived of something that shouldn’t be this hard at all? Other people also want to connect with others, but they don’t want me. No one I’ve ever met has been as isolated and alone as I am. Everyone has at least one friend, even if their friend is annoying, stupid, or insufferable. But me—specifically me—no one wants. I am the outcast, the unwanted one, the one with a personality that even I hate, and everyone else hates, too.


Every time I tried to make an effort to form friendships, my weirdness and terrible social skills would show in the most embarrassing way possible. From kindergarten to the end of middle school, I spent most of my time alone, and my friends were extremely limited. I feel like this affected my basic social skills when trying to meet new people. I didn’t know how to introduce myself properly or pick up on the social cues people use. I was literally dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb. No one would ever be proud to walk next to someone like that. So, of course, I remained alone. But in high school, somehow, by pure coincidence, my social life suddenly flourished because of a few lucky events. I don’t even know how it happened. I felt popular, I enjoyed school, and my personality improved in a way that made me unable to imagine my life without my friends.


But then we graduated. And now, here I am—25 years old, feeling like my personality is stuck at 18 or 19. I haven’t achieved anything, I don’t know anyone, and I haven’t moved forward from my room. Every time I look into people’s eyes in the street, it feels like my shame takes the form of a giant being in the sky, crushing what little self-worth I have left. I feel my inferiority, my delay, my weakness. I feel envious of everyone. My future is over.


I won’t say I want to kill myself or anything like that, because I’m not stupid. I know full well that if I did, the only reaction people would have would be mockery, ridicule, and laughter at me and everything I’ve felt—all the emotions that no one knows about. I don’t blame them. I mean, what else would you expect from a weirdo who lived seven years unnoticed? Did you really think there would be any other reaction? Huh, you idiot?
That’s why I would never harm myself through suicide. Because that would only prove everyone right—that my existence is as good as nonexistent. Honestly, even calling myself ""human"" is a compliment, because I’m less than that. No one has ever acknowledged my existence, as if I was meant to be erased from the world, as if I never felt any of the emotions they feel. But my will is strong. And I’m not saying I’ll become a criminal or physically attack people—no, never. That’s not who I am.



But I swear, all the pain and isolation I’ve felt will have an impact. The suffering that has destroyed my body and drained me—I will return it to the world. My pain has meaning. My emotions have value. No matter how much I want to reconnect with people, I can’t force myself to forget these past seven years. I just wanted someone to look at me like a normal person. Forget being a friend—just a normal human being. And then maybe, maybe we could become friends. But everyone sees me as weird.



I swear, I hate all of you. I swear to God, I hope you all suffer and feel pain, and I won’t allow myself to feel any sympathy. Because sympathy is mutual, and if no one feels for me, I swear I won’t feel for them either. If I’m not human like you, then you’re not human to me either.
This time has been enough to prove to me that I have no value in this world. My life has been at a standstill, and it still is. My existence is as good as nothing. But I will make sure my feelings don’t just disappear like they never existed. With whatever remains of my life, I will make sure I prove my existence to everyone, and I will take my revenge.",2025-03-20 12:57:28,5,3,mentalillness,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1jflc5c/7_years_of_isolation_amde_me_hate_humans/,years isolation amde hate humans,0.208,0.667,0.125,-0.9993,high
1jrrhwu,insignificant child.,"i am 18, and i have an older sister who is 21. when i was about 11 or 12 and she was 14 she started going to therapy due to ""issues in school"" (i put this in quotations due to me not believing anything really happened as she for sure would have told me about it, im willing to find out im wrong though). my parents always treated her with kindness and patience and would always talk nicely about her to relatives or friends. 

around this same time i started suffering with depression due to trauma buildup and began to self-harm and imagine ending my own life. this went on ignored for years. if ever i showed weakness; like not being as happy as i pretended to be, or whenever they found out about my suicidal plans, it would be met with me being yelled at, and everything continuing as if nothing is wrong with me and my sister is the only one who ""needs help"", which turns out she does not need it, i can say with certainty. 

it took until i was 17, 5 or 6 years later, when i had attempted in my school and was actually discovered, i had attempted on many many occasions before this, and the school had to contact my parents to figure out what happened. it went on ignored again, until a therapy appointment i had to attend which ended in me having to go to A&E. even now over a year later they still make no steps to help me, and believe everything is fine with me or im seeking attention.

my sister will get grumpy and pissy if she isnt given what she wants, my parents always oblige even if i dont want to. she tries to poke into everyones private life but will become defensive if anyone asks her a question about hers. my parents dont do anything to stop this, whereas if it was me doing it i would be yelled at mercilessly. 

imagine what it must have felt like, struggling with severe depression from a young age, just to be ignored and dismissed for years, attempting on your life many times, still to be yelled at and then dismissed. 

i have spent years telling myself i mean nothing to anyone including my parents. that they would do anything for my sister even if she doesnt need it, yet for me they would ignore me and not try to help. 

i dont know if ive made a coherent understandable post. but i just want to die. what would it matter to anyone? i have no real friends, my sister is in her own selfish world, and my parents likely wouldnt notice if i went missing.

1jk64t2,I fret that I have serious illness,"I’m too scared to say the word or to even like type this out idk, I’m scared it’ll be like I’m manifesting it to happen, or trick my brain into thinking I have it and it makes it happen. 

So a year ago, my boobs started to really hurt like everyday. I thought it was because I was getting over my eating disorder and my boobs we’re getting big again. At some point, I felt one lump inside my boob, got really scared, and then checked again a couple weeks later, and it was gone. I know that is a good sign though. The pain continued though, it was an everyday thing. I still struggled with it for a month or two after getting with my boyfriend but then I got a lot better. Anyway, boobs still hurt.  

Out of no where, there was a ton of lumps inside my boobs. They would get somewhat better and then bad again, once again, I know that’s a good sign. I guess the issue is is that it hasn’t gotten better. It doesn’t necessarily change much after my period, they’re still there. 

I got an ultrasound, to get somewhat descriptive of these two lumps, they were very hard and going out of my breasts. On my left side it was middle boob going out to my ribs, right boob it was going towards my armpit but not on my armpit. They pressed down really hard and it actually moved them back inside my boob, they were so sore lol. Those two lumps haven’t changed, and the right one really, really hurts to touch. While they were doing it, they honestly looked like they were going to cry. They came back in and told me I was okay and were really happy about it, smiling n everything. Like I said, it hasn’t really gotten better. My boobs get very hard, painful to touch, and especially where the lumps are. They hurt anyway regardless if they’re touched or not. Maybe I’m just siking myself out. 

I feel like I’m having skin changes but I honestly wouldn’t know. Now, on my right arm where my elbow is, it appears swollen and once again the skin looks different, and the spot hurts to touch. Also, I think it’s my thyroids? They’re swollen, I’m not sick, but they’re also hard. And I felt a small lump on my neck that I’ve felt a couple other times. I know there’s a possibility it could spread if it was bad. 

Idk, I’m totally freaking out. My lungs have been strange too, I had to stop smoking n shit so it could just be because of smoking. 

My body hurts a lot, sharp pains, shit like that. It feels internal, but then if I touch those spots it usually hurts too. For example, my upper back around my spine. The other day I was bending down to pick up my bag and once again my back hurt, so I touched it and like pushed something back in place 😟 

I would totally ask to go again but our insurance is terrible, we have to pay for all our bills full price, and we’re currently not doing the best since my dad lost his job and hadn’t found a new one yet. I mean we’re doing alright, but it wouldn’t be ideal to pay off a medical bill right now. 

I just am so paranoid. I don’t want it to be something bad. I feel bad for even thinking it could be. It makes me feel really bad because people do have it and have to go through that. It makes me feel guilty for even worrying about it. My body just hurts a lot, feels sore, all that. I just worry that I’ll die. And my like lady area, that hurts too. Not to give a tmi, but there’s this spot on the inside of my hooha that like feels really weird. I stopped using tampons because whatever it was, it got caught on the applicator. Every now and then, it’ll get like really itchy down there, aggressively using the back of my foot to scratch that shit with my clothes. 

I don’t know, everything just hurts. I considered killing myself a lot, but my new meds, adderol, actually made me stop thinking of suicide/self harm altogether. So I guess I won’t be doing that now. Worse case scenario, I’ll find myself a gun, get drunk as fuck, and just do it. I just want to be healthy again. I’d take being mentally bad over this any day. At least my body would be okay, even if I hated myself.

1j64uj0,I genuinely think that I am not cut out for life,"
I don't think I'm cut out for life. I don't feel like I'm fit in or in place. I am emotionally sensitive and empathetic. I don't feel like I belong. I can't find a job that pays a liveable wage. I have had a good amount of jobs for my age.  Don't have a driver license yet and I can't afford lessons right now but whats the point if I can't afford a car. Even if I work full time and make 600 a week I still wouldn't be able to afford one.

 I am in community college for accounting. I worked 30 hours a week at a pharmacy and made 400 a week still not enough. I can't afford anything and it sucks to know that this is how life is and I would have to work 3 jobs. I reduced my hours to focus on studying but now I can't afford hobbies or all of my needs and definitely not any wants. 

Right now I'm still studying but don't know how I will keep paying for college since my father is a tax evader for fafsa. I could do a payment plan but It will be all of my money. I binge eat. I don't have anyone to talk to. I have mental illnesses including depression and when I was on antidepressants I gained lots of weight and binge eating got worse so I stopped. I see a therapist and it doesn't help all they do is just suggest meds. 

My dad is dying and I never grieved my brother committing suicide. I'm lonely but a man could quickly make my life worse and more complicated. All the jobs I've been applying to virtually pay the same $12-18. I'm back to self harming. I feel like a failure and feel guilty for being alive. My parents are abusive but I don't want to have a victim complex. I still live with them and I am not able to afford to move out even with roommates. Maybe my expectations for earning is too high and my standards for life as well.

I went to beauty school to become a certified nail technician just to find that there's virtually no job openings out there for that near me at the moment. Or they are part time working 1-2 days a week. I'm considering selling press ons though but its a saturated market and I don't know who would buy from me. I have had 2 businesses ages 16-20 that flopped. Multiple hobbies that flopped and there is absolutely nothing that I am passionate about or enjoy. I don't enjoy entertainment either.

I'm not sure what to do with my life and how to feel better and I have been forcing myself for the past few weeks to forget every single thing and move forward but I genuinely do not see much to be happy about.

When I confided in my friend she said I'm privileged and my life is not that bad and they have it worse. I'm not doubting others have it worse at all. What prompted me to write this post is while searching for a new job because my current one I am very underpaid and staff is toxic and I am sick of abuse from the customers, I realized I still can barely find anything that would allow me to live that I got overwhelmed and cried and my mother said that I need to grow up and asked me how am I going to manage to survive which is true, and I don't think I will to be honest. She also said that me crying causes her stress and said that the stress I cause her and my dad is what turns them to drink. She says I make excuses which I think is true in some cases. I have been dissocoating for the past 6 years and every second every minute every week every month and every year passes by me in seconds. I will wake up one day and be 50 if i make it to then wondering where all the time has gone. 

I think the people in my life think I am weak which is true. I'm not even trying to seek pity or be self pity or a victim but I just don't see the point. I am not a victim it is all my fault and I believe any abuse that I have endured I must of have deserved it. I just get easily overwhelmed and I don't know why and I am immature. 

I don't know what to do with my life and I need someone to tell me.

1jrq32b,I’m 15 and struggling with mental health and ADHD. My school ignored me – until I ended up in the psych ward,"I’m a 15-year-old girl, and I’m incredibly angry. I feel like I need to express my feelings somehow – and since I don’t know where else to go, here it is.

I’ve struggled with mental health for as long as I can remember. I first contacted CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) in 2022 when I was 12, seeking help for self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and more. In 2024, I was diagnosed with ADHD and started medication. Before that, school was incredibly hard for me. And my school… is complete chaos.

My principal is extremely conflict-avoidant and refuses to implement individual accommodations. Instead, she sees suggestions as criticism and does everything she can to maintain a “perfect” reputation. The school counselor isn’t great either. In sixth grade, I had a good class but an incredibly unprofessional teacher. He insulted me daily – told me I was worthless, that I’d never become anything, that something was wrong with me. It got so bad that I started recording some of our conversations. My self-confidence was already low, and hearing those things every day from a teacher just crushed me. I tried to switch classes all year, but my principal said it was “unnecessary.” So I kept suffering through each day.

At the end of sixth grade, we got to write down names of people we wanted to be in the same class as next year. I tried to be strategic and chose friends I worked well with. On the last day of school, we got our new class lists. I was the only one in the entire year who didn’t get a single friend. Literally. I knew no one in the new class.

I was devastated. My parents called the principal and counselor multiple times. I even sent an email explaining how excluded I felt. Here’s part of that email:

⸻

“Hi (principal) and (school counselor),

I just want to ask – what were you thinking when you created the class lists? I’ve looked around and realized that everyone except me ended up with at least one friend. I’m honestly really upset and feel quite excluded. I’ve explained this to many adults – my therapist, chiropractor, etc. – and they all say this is bullying, and I actually agree. I think it’s been pretty obvious that I don’t really hang out with anyone in this new class. You told my mom **** and dad ****** that I’d be fine without close friends because of my “well-developed skills.” I know I make friends easily, but this still feels hurtful.

Throughout the year, I’ve had a lot of issues with (that awful teacher), and whenever I tried to find solutions, like changing class, it felt like you didn’t take me seriously. That was also degrading. And now, when I don’t get placed with any of my close friends, I’m just heartbroken.

School staff should not be excluding students. I hope you understand that. This is deeply unfair, and I truly hope you’ll reconsider. I’m 13. I shouldn’t have to spend my time dealing with this. I’m extremely disappointed.

I expect you to contact my parents and offer me a class change as soon as possible.”

⸻

All I got back was a short reply: “We have absolutely not excluded you.”

After summer break, when I started 7th grade, things got even worse. I felt completely uncomfortable in my new class and, as expected, didn’t make any friends. I started skipping school more and more just so I could attend lessons, breaks, and lunch with my friends from other classes. My mental health declined even more, and of course, skipping school meant I fell behind. Normally, my GPA is around 300 (Swedish grading system), but not then.

I kept asking to change classes. I had meeting after meeting with my principal. In one meeting, I opened up and explained how much anxiety the class was causing me, only to hear things like, “That’s not normal,” “You’re looking at this the wrong way,” “I don’t believe that,” etc. I remember that meeting like it was yesterday – I went home crying because I felt so belittled and mocked by my principal.

Toward the end of the term, my new teacher (who was amazing, by the way) told me he’d noticed I didn’t have any friends and asked if I’d thought about switching classes. That was the last straw for my family. My dad eventually threatened to pull me out of school if I wasn’t allowed to change. Finally, they agreed to a “trial period” in a new class from January to Easter break.

The difference was night and day. My mental health improved so much, my absences dropped by over 300%, and my grades went up. When Easter break ended, I expected a decision, but the principal just said, “Go to that class today, and we’ll see what happens.” I broke down. I was terrified they’d send me back to the old class and make me relive all of it. My dad contacted the school immediately, and with support from CAMHS, I was allowed to stay in the new class.

Shortly after that, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I’d been asking for accommodations for ages, but of course, the school wouldn’t consider it. They “don’t have the resources” to help students who need support. After several care meetings, they finally agreed to small things like a more structured term plan. But nothing ever actually happened. Now, in the second term of 8th grade, it’s still the same. I’ve been promised so much, but they don’t want to accept any “criticism.”

When I explain that, for example, our schedule (which we students book ourselves, by the way) is difficult for me to manage, they say, “But it works for everyone else, so it should work for you too.” First of all – not everyone learns the same way. Every school will have students who need accommodations. Secondly, it doesn’t work for everyone else – over 50% of students at my school are behind in their work.

And now to the reason I’m so upset.

As I said, I’ve been promised a lot without anything ever changing. The school knows about my ADHD and my mental health. On Monday, I was hospitalized at a psychiatric emergency unit for the first time because I was doing really badly. My mom emailed my teacher to inform him and once again explain that I need support in school because stress is a big factor in how I’m doing mentally.

Suddenly, everything changed.

The teacher talked to the others. And today, it was no problem at all to make accommodations. In just 30 minutes, my teacher and I created a term plan together. Other teachers told me that if things feel overwhelming, we can work it out together.

All of this… in one day.
That would never have happened if I hadn’t been hospitalized.

And that’s what makes me so angry. Is that what it takes for a 15-year-old to get help at school? Do you have to end up in a psych ward before anyone listens? That’s insane.

I immediately think of one of my close friends – let’s call her Anna. She has dyslexia and gets zero help. She struggles so much with math, and our math teacher has a very strong accent and speaks too fast for us to follow. After a 40-minute lesson, Anna still doesn’t understand. I explain the same thing in 5 minutes, and she gets it. My 5 minutes help her more than the teacher’s entire lesson.

But should that really be my responsibility? I lose valuable time that a special ed teacher should be giving her. But the school “can’t afford that.” Apparently, it’s more important to buy artificial grass for the football field.

Anna has also asked for accommodations but hasn’t received any. Maybe she also has to be hospitalized before they take her seriously.

I’m so angry. I’m so tired.
I don’t know if anyone will read all of this or take the time to reply.
But I needed to get it off my chest.

1jqxm89,I don’t wanna take my medicine,"So here’s my situation. It’s the end of the day at partial hospitalization, and I’m sitting there waiting for my mom to finish talking with my therapist. I’m feeling super anxious because I have this ongoing fear that they’re going to tell her everything I share in 
sessions. It’s not like I think they’re going to spill everything, but it just feels like my personal business is up for grabs. My mom finally comes out, and we start talking. She asks me how my day went, and I said it was good

Then, she asks me how I feel about taking this new medication. I thought 
We’re talking about buspirone. I told her, “I hope it helps,” and then we got onto the topic of me staying longer in the program. I was supposed to leave soon, but now it looks like I’ll be staying until the 23rd. So, I ask her, “Wait, hold on, what’s this new medication you’re talking about?” She didn’t know the name, so I ask, “Is it Remarant?” And she says, “Yeah, yeah, it’s that.”

I immediately remember that we had already agreed I wouldn’t take it because it I told my mom to say no because at first I said yes but then I over thought about the waking as a side effect so I told my mom to say no because I was too embarrassed to say no at first and I told my mom to say no because of side effects, 


I didn’t tell my mom t that it had weight came as a side effect
at first because I knew she’d push for me to take it anyway. She wants me to gain weight because I’m underweight—102 pounds at 5’4” and 16 years old, and I know she worries about that. But I really don’t want to take it. I told her, “I don’t want to take that Remarant stuff,” and she asked why. I said, “I looked it up, and there are side effects I don’t like, especially the weight gain. I’m already so insecure about my body right now, and meds that make me gain weight—like when I was on Seroquel or Zyprexa—really mess with me.” She wasn’t convinced. She kept pushing, asking why I didn’t want to take it, and I told her it was because of the weight gain, plus other side effects like headaches.

She then said, “So, you don’t want to take it because of weight gain? That makes me want you to take it even more because you need to eat more.” At this point, I’m like, “What? Why are they pushing this one medication so much? There are so many others out there that could help me in the same way!” She told me they were pushing it because it would help with my mood and keep me stable, helping with intrusive thoughts. I get that, but I kept insisting, “There are other meds out there that do the same thing. Remarant isn’t the only one.”

We also talked about how long I’ll stay in partial hospitalization. She said, “I think you should stay because yesterday when I asked you to talk about yourself, you only said two good things and then went on to say bad things about yourself.” I told her those “bad things” are things she’s said about me, like calling me selfish, a liar, and comparing me to a narcissist. I took those on because I thought it was about accountability, but now it’s like she’s saying, “When do you ever change?” I know she calls me selfish because of the time I tried to commit suicide, and a liar because I don’t always tell her the truth about how I’m feeling. She calls me defiant for calling an ambulance instead of going to her when I was in crisis. But I don’t go to her when I’m struggling because all she does is pray, and I’ve told her that, but she doesn’t seem to understand.

We argued a bit, and she said, “You need to stay in the program because your lows are so low and your highs are so high, and you go to extremes. You do impulsive things without thinking them through.” Then she said, “They don’t think you’re ready to leave the program either. Yes, you’re improving, but your mood is still a bit unstable.” Honestly, I still self-harm a lot, and I feel really depressed. I know my mom calls me a liar, and I get why, because I hide my mental state from her to avoid her saying how she can’t handle to have me back in the hospital and back in the cycle again and how it stresses her out she tells me that almost every day so I feel like why would I tell you the truth if it stresses you out and then she always brings God into it, which makes me feel uncomfortable and I’ve expressed that but she told me if I ever wanted her to stop talking about God and I told her that she might as well hang up the hat of being my mother, she won’t do anything physical, like kick me out or anything but I feel like we would be emotionally, distant, and we have really good times together every single day and I don’t wanna lose those times


She always says she can’t handle me going back to the hospital or treatment again, and it sounds so sad when she says it. She lost her job and now has just one job because her other job didn’t accommodate her when she had to pick me up and do all those things for me so that’s why I don’t burden her with my problems anymore because she always says how she can’t handle it and how she’s so stressed out from everything so I’m like might as well just pretend that I’m better but she gets mad and she’s like don’t do that because I wanna be there for you and she’s like even if you do need the treatment again then I’ll make a sacrifice but then she says she can’t handle it and all that so I’m like what do I do?

What’s shocking is that when I got discharged from the hospital the first time, she didn’t even get my medication. I had a whole manic episode, but she told me I didn’t need it, even though I was staying up for days and couldn’t stop moving. She’s always been against me taking medication or going to therapy, but now she wants me to take this Remarant, mainly because of the weight gain side effect.

So yeah, everyone thinks I’m getting better, but I’m really not. I technically do need medication, but I don’t want that one. I’m not denying I need help—I just don’t want that specific medication. I don’t want them to label me as delusional for not wanting it, like they’ve done before. I’ve been in situations where, if I say something they don’t like, they just throw it back at me and make me feel guilty for saying anything at all.

At the end of the day, it’s like I’m stuck in a cycle. I need help, but I also need my voice to be heard. I feel torn between needing to comply and not wanting to take medication that I’m not comfortable with. Does anyone else feel this way or have advice?
Also at the end of me and my mom‘s talk today, she told me to make a list of medication since there is alternatives to that one so we could talk about it on Monday, but I feel like they’re still not gonna listen

1jjy67u,i’m in crisis and idk how to handle it or what to do,"trigger warning- self harm

for some background i have pretty severe anxiety and ocd. i just started seeing a therapist 4 months ago and have been on 100mg of sertraline for 2 months but feel nothing. 

for the past few weeks ive had horrible anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts. my dog passed away, work has been horrible and mentally taxing for months but is only getting increasingly worse, a coworker made a joke at my expense that caused me to completely shut down at work, and the doorknob on the bathroom door broke and it was left ajar for days (that’s my biggest compulsion and i used to lose sleep and self harm over it). 

i know it’s a lot at once and probably what is causing this but ive missed 6 days of work and have a really hard time getting out of bed to go to work or really anything. i will randomly start hyperventilating and throwing up. my internal monologue is just screaming at me to make it all stop. i have constant intrusive thoughts to harm myself (some which i have acted on) and to end my life. the entirety of my 30 minute commute today consisted of intrusive thoughts of crashing my car in different ways. i don’t want to die but im scared that my thoughts are going to get worse or that im going to act on impulse. my internal monologue is also telling me that my meds are poison and that i need to flush them. i’m dissociating heavily to the point where i don’t know where i am. i can’t look in the mirror because i don’t recognize myself. well i kind of do but everything with my appearance just seems off as if someone drew me from memory. i spent half an hour just staring at myself in the mirror last night. 

i see my therapist in 2 days and i don’t really know if there’s anything i can do until then or what i should do. idk if i should talk to her about committing myself, i was kind of hoping to get in for an appointment today but she didn’t have any availability. i also don’t know if my crisis is even bad enough to go to a facility at all. i’m just scared.

1jgzyzc,i’m confused,"i’ve dealt with anxiety my whole life and i’m just confused. i will occasionally have bouts of paranoia, always at night, and always that i’m being watched. the conditions are very specific: it’s usually something/someone in my room, they appear to be human but they aren’t, they’re contorted, they have red eyes and sharp teeth, and i will only be harmed(specifically eaten) if i see them. when this happens, i just leave my light off and try to sleep. rationally, i know that nobody is in my room, but i don’t want to risk anything, even if there’s a small chance. this has only happened a handful of times: 1) a woman died in my area after being trapped in an arby’s freezer —> i thought of the lady that died in the water tank at that one hotel —> i convinced myself that a man did these incidents and i was going to be eaten by him. 
2) i watched monument mythos (analogue horror youtube series) —> i thought that the washington monument was going to come to my house and eat me 
3) i read a conspiracy theory that john lennon and kanye were replaced by lookalikes —> i thought of clones —> i thought that their clones are in my room and they’re going to eat me. 

*** very important to note that i don’t have any hallucinations and i do know that none of this is possible/real, but for some reason i still get scared. also, im not asking for any kind of diagnosis!! i know that this is due to anxiety disorder, but i just want to have insight into what causes these specific fears.

i really just want to know where this stems from. i’ve talked to two therapists and they can’t really give me an answer besides anxiety disorder and stress.",2025-03-22 06:58:39,1,1,mentalillness,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1jgzyzc/im_confused/,im confused,0.157,0.805,0.038,-0.9923,unknown

1jfp2pz,I'm going through immense suffering and people are laughing at me.,"I’m exhausted. Every day, I wake up and go to the hospital. I’ve seen doctors from almost every department, and yet, every single one tells me it’s just anxiety. I panic over the smallest things—like a tiny scratch—convinced it will turn into something serious. No matter how irrational it seems, I can’t stop myself from rushing to the hospital. Today, the staff even laughed at me because I’m there so often. I felt like a clown.

Meanwhile, I see people my age enjoying life—riding bikes with their partners, hanging out with friends—while I waste my time and my parents’ money on hospital visits. My biggest fear right now? That my penis is permanently damaged due to extreme masturbation—10 to 20 times a day for the past 10 years. I’ve had erectile dysfunction since 2022, and I suspect I have Peyronie’s disease, even though multiple urologists ruled it out. They say my penis looks normal, but how can they be sure without proper tests like a Penile Doppler Test? I’ve also been experiencing extreme numbness and discoloration in one part of my penis, yet doctors keep saying it’s okay. Are they being dismissive just because they assume my anxiety is making me imagine things? Do they have some kind of preconceived notion or prejudice against me—that I’m just an anxious, paranoid person and not worth taking seriously?

But where did this anxiety even start? Is it genetic? My father was always an anxious person—stressing over things others wouldn’t. He used to hit me almost every day until the 9th or 10th grade. I couldn’t fight back. As I grew older, I became toxic too. I started taking out my anger on my mother. The cycle of abuse continued until one day, I cut off contact with my father. He stopped abusing me, but I couldn’t stop myself from physically harming my mother. It became a part of our daily lives, and I know that’s not normal.

The worst part? Outside my home, I’m a completely different person. I don’t bully anyone. I don’t get into fights. But the moment I step inside, I become someone else. I hate it.

Sometimes, I feel like ending my life. But I don’t want to die. I still believe I can turn things around. I just don’t know how. I want to be loved. I want to be a good person. I want to be happy.

The happiest time in my life? When I was dating my ex. That was the first time I truly fell in love. I’ve been in relationships before, but this was different. I felt so joyful, so alive. And strangely, that was the period when I masturbated the least. My lust disappeared. I respected her so much that I couldn’t even think of her sexually, especially in the beginning. It felt like divine love—love without lust. I was obsessed with her, ready to do anything for her. But in the end, she ruined me. She cheated on me too.

So, what is it? Can love heal me? Or is it something I have to fix on my own? Am I like this because I’ve spent years stuck inside my room with no social life? I didn’t go to a regular college. After high school, I just stayed at home. Could that be the reason my mental health is so bad? Would having more sexual experiences help?

I don’t know what to do. I believe in God. I pray all the time, asking for relief, for happiness, for peace. But I’m still suffering. I just want to sit by the beach, watch the sunset, feel the breeze, and relax. But my mind won’t let me.

Even as I write this, my anxiety is telling me something terrible is about to happen. That I’ll get diagnosed with some awful disease. That my worst fears will come true. And if that happens, what will I do? Cry? Give up? Live in misery forever?

I don’t know. But I do know I need to change. I need to save myself. I just don’t know where to start.

If you’ve read this far, thank you. Please, any advice or suggestions would mean a lot.",2025-03-20 16:36:59,2,1,mentalillness,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1jfp2pz/im_going_through_immense_suffering_and_people_are/,im going immense suffering people laughing .,0.168,0.681,0.151,-0.7751,high
1j6a723,Something is wrong with me and I don’t know what to do,"THIS CONTAINS SELF HARM. I think, not entirely sure? Anyway. To preface: I’m a 15 year old girl and I have already been diagnosed with ADHD and Autism, but this is not my concern. Lately, I have been having very explosive anger outbursts over small things and in result I have been hyperventilating, scratching myself until I bleed, and disassociating heavily. I always have a strong urge to do something big like rip out my hair or punch a hole in my wall or throw my phone at concrete and to cope with these feelings I’ve just been scratching my skin. As an example, today I was watching tv in my living room and my mom came home and turned off the fan that I had on. (She has issues with fans and doesn’t like the way they feel). I got very upset because it was hot in the living room, and I asked her if we could come to a compromise, to which she absolutely refused. It made me super upset for some reason and I felt like the only thing I could do was leave the room before I said or did something I would regret. I had already started crying (for some reason?) before I left the room, and when I did leave the room, my dad said “perfect timing”(meaning now he could take over the tv for himself since I was leaving) and it just made me feel so embarrassed and defeated. I left to my room and hyperventilated/sobbed while throwing things and being incredibly destructive for a good 45 minutes before I decided to take a bath. I was still crying and sobbing heavily when I got into the bath and then I really started scratching my arms. Both arms are now really scratched up and I just feel really stupid for over reacting so terribly. During all of this, I felt out of my body. It felt like my mind would be running with thoughts but I couldn’t control my body or I felt like I was someone else. Along with this, I feel like I am slowly losing my sense of self. I don’t want to do things I usually enjoy and I have no idea what I look like. Some days I think I’m absolutely hideous and I don’t want anyone to see me or even go outside, while other days I think that everyone is looking at me because I look good.. So overall I just feel like I’m losing myself and I don’t know what to do. If anyone reads this, thank you. (I hope I did this right, this is my first Reddit post. Also, I am trying my best to not violate the rules here so, I am not looking for a formal diagnosis but rather some advice on what do to with myself here).",2025-03-08 08:28:30,3,1,mentalillness,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1j6a723/something_is_wrong_with_me_and_i_dont_know_what/,something wrong dont know,0.128,0.751,0.121,-0.7067,unknown
1j6dzdd,"Childhood memories, symptom diagnosis suggestions? Vent","Hey Reddit, I know the internet is not always the best tool for a mental health diagnosis but I no longer suffer from these symptoms and haven’t for some time so even a false diagnosis would cause no harm, I just want answers out of curiosity. As a child I had severe anger issues, a problem with compulsive lying even if it got me in more trouble than the truth, and whenever my mom would explain to other people how awful I could be I would always act like an angel in public and have great manners but only act bad in my house, I also went through a pyromaniac phase at 11. Not sure if those traits are gonna help towards a conclusion but maybe they will so just dropping that info. I can’t remember the dreams but I remember feeling impending doom after waking up from them and my mom would come in my room and in the middle of the night and said she woke up to me yelling and scratching the wall which I didn’t even know was possible from night terrors. I also up until I turned about fifteen would always see “shadow people” frequently but not clearly, always in my peripheral vision and couldn’t make it out, I’d see the silhouette of a dark figure opening my closed door and then look at my door and my doors still closed and stuff like that. I also valued pets like my dogs just as much if not more so than I did people and still do, I was hard to control so was mostly in my room grounded from 6- 13 years old with my books and my dogs to keep me company so they became my company. I grew up with a single mom working two jobs who was gone before I woke up and home after I was asleep, but we lived with her old friend who we would find out to be a severely sick narcissist, when my mom wasn’t home she would give me the “ slap you and give you candy” treatment. Never physically, but emotionally, she would tell me my mom didn’t believe in me, but she did pretty much, and just wanted to feed into the idea of me hating my mom and liking her as an ego thing. She was a compulsive liar as well who even ate all my Halloween candy one year and blamed it on me so my mom got mad at me since I had an eating disorder. My traits developed around the same time we moved in with her, were these learned from her or was I just this way as a kid. No doctors could give my mom a definitive diagnosis and they just gave me a bunch of treatment drugs like lithium to calm me despite having no idea what was wrong with me. At around 14 I started to lose my anger, and the only thing that made it leave was sadness, because of all the stress I caused my mom and nights she spent crying after I said I hated her, I thought she hated me but it was her friend lying all those years and I felt terrible. Ever since that realization I physically can’t feel “rage” I can get annoyed but I literally haven’t felt true anger since and that also worries me.

TW: selh harm/depression 
I've always been called crazy. Usually it was a joke, because i am that one friend that will do anything with no hesitation. But for the past couple of years it has made its own dark effects. Sometimes, when i look at my hands my mind tell me this is not how they're supposed to look. It makes me slit my wrists trying to get the blood out of me. Recently the same thing started to happen with faces around me. I look at someone and it hits me that this is not how one should look. I look at my skin and it feels unfamiliar. But its so pretty! Im usually cheerfull, but i have periods where i get very depressed for months, start having suicidal thoughts. Its like there is no in-between. About 90% of the time there are intrusive thoughts in my mind, telling me to just kill myself. I've made it a game - i gave those thoughts bodies, theyre dark blue and green hedgehogs. I pretend that its their job to tell me to kill myself, so i can usually brush them kff pretty easy, by locking them up in their cages. Its all in my mind anyway. There is also a ghost in my room who wants to kill me. Ive made friends with her. She still hates me. I don't care. My walls are lovers. 
I feel like im mad, but when i try to tell someone they don't believe me. I feel like im high most of the time despite being clean. Maybe i just have wild imagination. Its not always funny. I don't know what to do. Yesterday i had a chat with random person on the bus about the matrix. He was one of those people who talk to themselves in public. We became friends, i think. We were both the same. 
Today the classroom was shaking and no one else seemed to notice. Everything is spinning. It has been spinning a lot for the past months. I tried to admit myself to an asylum but they need parental permission. Also in my country the asylums look like they're frim a horror movie. They're so pretty! 
Some days i feel like im on the verge of completely losing it. Other days i try to get a break from living by just existing. So really, am i crazy? What do i do? I've tried to attempt once when the depression got me good, but realised i couldn't do it. The voices don't bother me much but there are some moments. Makes me a danger to myself. 
Ps. I know this sounds like a fanfic written by a 12 years old. Im sorry. I also apologise for any errors.",2025-03-17 00:15:14,1,0,mentalillness,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1jcvy34/am_i_crazy/,crazy ?,0.155,0.726,0.12,-0.9753,high
1j78o01,"prolonged grief, chaos&hell","
Before I begin, I just want to say that this is going to be a very chaotic vent filled with self-pity. I’ve never shared these feelings in real life, not even with a therapist or anyone, because I feel so ashamed of myself. But I need to get this out. If you’re reading this, I apologize in advance for making you go through this jumble of thoughts.
—————————

also possible TW? (death/loss/self-harm/ED/SI) 


⸻——————-




The only reason I keep going is because I don’t want to destroy my parents. I can’t bear the thought of putting my mom through all of this. I feel selfish for wanting to give up when I know there are people around me who care and want to see me fight through it.

At the same time, I don’t feel like I deserve to feel like this. I feel like I haven’t suffered enough to warrant healing or anything of that sort.

I’m still mourning my silent attempts, the ones that hurt me deeply, but I stayed quiet. I never spoke up. They weren’t loud or dramatic attempts, and I guess because of that, I feel like they don’t matter. I’ve struggled with an eating disorder for years, but I’m not even underweight. In fact, right now, I’m overweight, and it feels like I’m failing at everything.

My self-harm? Yeah, it’s bad, but is it really that bad? I’ve never had to go to the hospital. I’ve never had stitches. Most of my scars are shallow now.

But the thing is, I’ve been overlooked and dismissed my entire life. People don’t care until you’re on the verge of losing everything. I’ve had a licensed therapist tell me that my scars weren’t serious compared to her other clients. I’ve had people tell me that my grief isn’t justified.

Yes, people validated my grief when I lost both of my grandparents, especially my grandmother, who was like my second mom. But even then, I felt like I had no right to grieve. My mom lost both of her parents in a short span of time, and I couldn’t help but feel like my grief wasn’t as valid as hers.

When it comes to pets, especially smaller ones, some people just don’t understand. 
They say, “It’s just a pet, you’ll get over it,” but I didn’t lose a pet. I lost my best friend, my purpose, my reason to keep going. Losing my first cat wasn’t just a loss; it was everything.

As for friendships, people just say, “People come and go.” “It’s not like they died.” 
But the truth is, I lost the most meaningful and authentic relationships I’ve ever had. I lost the people I trusted enough to truly be myself around, the ones who knew me in a way no one else ever did.

Lately, I’ve been feeling incredibly alone. I’m about to drop out of college, and all the grief I’ve been suppressing is surfacing. I’ve been dissociating and numbing myself for so long that it feels like everything is hitting me all at once. On top of that, I’m moving out on my own, and I’m slowly losing contact with my roommate, the only friend I still have.

Look at me, though—how pathetic it is that I can’t just shake off this self-pity.

1j74afu,"I push away a lot of friends, I don't know what to do and now I am suicidal","Hey everyone, I'm 19M from India and last half a decade I've lost every friend I've cared for. I don't know how but I manage to push everyone in my life away. Those who I don't, tell me I act like I am better than them even though I never mean to. I've tried watching self improvement videos on topics like:

- Am I a narcissist? 
- Am I secretly gaslighting people? 
- Am I unlikable? 
- Am I making my friends feel ignored? 

And I have improved on everything the videos told me to do

I trust my friends and make sure that they can trust me by never spilling secrets and always being present if they need me physically or emotionally(this I always used to do to begin with but I even went ahead and started doing it even more by checking up on them everytime they had the slightest hint of sadness in their voice and just in general) 

I always try to communicate if I feel like they're doing something which is hurting me, I try to never talk in symbolisms and just tell them straight up if something bothers me. 

I also always try to tell them how much I appreciate them. 

I try to never leave people ona read either. 

I also just try to be present and just do everything in my power to make sure that they don't hate me. 

If they tell me they don't like something, I try to be mindful of not doing that thing around them. 

And they still end up hating me. Always. And at this point IDK what to do. I feel alone. My mother already has told me in past that, she would exchange me for another child in a heartbeat, and similarly for my father he has also said that I stress him out. Even though I always try to just be genuine with everyone. I feel as though anyone who is now in my life is out of kindness of their heart and not because they like me (which I don't want, I don't wanna burden anyone, but I don't know what else to do either) 

Yesternight, yet another friend blocked me because I let them down, by abandoning them. We were on a call and I was helping him with something. When we got to a point where I believed he could handle everything himself, he muted me for a bit so I texted him asking if he was there? He replied with a snarky no and I just said well if you're not their I am going to sleep.

It was 1 AM and I believed they could handle everything from this point on, I didn't think that would be a big deal + I had been contacting this friend for a month but he always said he had no time, was leaving me on read for every message I sent and when I told them that I didn't like the fact that they were leaving me on read and I felt like that meant that they didn't care for me they said ""I don't, but Imma let you think that because it's entertaining"" AND now when he needed my help he suddenly had time but not to talk, just to get help, he would mute me eveytime he started a process and not speak to me even though I just wanted to catch up. I laid on bed after this and I tried going to sleep but I started feeling restless so I contacted him and asked him if he still needed help, to which they replied with FUCK OFF I thought he was just being salty because the process failed but when I continued texting him he just replied with more FUCK OFFs at this point I panicked thinking I had pissed him off(I had) and I called him to apologize and explain that I didn't mean to offend him, he cut my call and I started spiraling. This friend in particular knows that I have lost a lot of friends in past and so I thought if he was doing this, this was serious and I started frantically texting him ""I'm sorry"" And calling repeatedly because I didn't want to lose him. He just kept cutting my calls and blocked me at one point with 0 explanation. 

In retrospect I realize that my last reaction may have been the reason I was blocked, but he knew that I was afraid of losing him and he knew that I would've gone through any lengths to keep our friendship alive. So I just felt like I had done something wrong enough to mandate that reaction and that made my gut turn. Which led to me hyperventilating and trying self harm (I cut myself a few times, but nothing more than that yet). In that moment I just wanted him to forgive me because without him, I'd feel alone again and I don't know how to cope with it anymore. 

I just got off of call with suicide prevention hotline because I realise (from all the self help videos) suicide isn't the way to go. But I don't know what else works at this point. 

I'm making this post as a last resort because I genuinely don't know where I am headed with life anymore. How should I gain friends and how should I even hold myself.

1joytkf,How to live with guilt,"31M here. Did something quite simply described as true evil a few years ago. I really can’t say what I did, but let’s just put it on the same level as homicide/rape or something of the sort, and no this isn’t something stupid like cheating on spouse or stealing something. 

Apologizing or acknowledging it is not an option as it would end my life as I know it, I would undoubtedly go to prison. Prison is not beneficial to anyone expect the private prison industry and I think being free allows me more opportunity to right my wrong over time and overall just add something positive to the world.

Also, prison causes more harm as there are people that 100% rely on me to live(I’m a caretaker for family) and without me around I truly think that I would be doing them an injustice that would just add to the list of harm I have done.

There is no undoing what I have done. I’m basically looking for forgiveness when it cannot be given. How do I live with myself?

Something was mentally wrong with me, and sometime after my actions, something in my brain clicked and I became a different person almost overnight. I am disgusted with my self and the only reason I’m still here is everyday I try to make up for it and convince myself I am not that person anymore.

1jlijci,So umm,"A while ago, ~1 month ago, I posted something in a different subreddit that asked a question that basically was like ""Do I have something or am I just thinking crazy"" (it was a lot longer but still). I'm 13, turning 14 later this year, and I know that I shouldn't be trying to over-pathologist myself or whatever, but I'm starting to really think I have something. I think it's really dumb or whatever of me to ask a question like this again knowing the answers are just gonna be on the lines of ""it's just puberty"" or ""don't do that"" or something. Anyway, I've been thinking like this again because I've sometimes randomly started to dislike myself. Think against things I previously thought about or liked, and felt I was more a nuisance than normal. Nearly simultaneously, I would feel I was going crazy, and that people would be better without me. I'm not sxxxdal and would never harm myself ever but it's kinda odd that this would happen. Also while that would happen, I would be quiet and just stare at whatever I was originally doing, wether it be school work or a conversation it could happen. Usually, I'm a louder person, often making dumb jokes and being confident in whatever I do, but ever since I randomly couldn't sleep one night I've had these random moments where I just stop what I'm doing, and feel more negative than usual. Again, I don't think I'm gonna get any responses from anyone that I haven't already heard, but I've been losing my  mind over this and just need something more than ""don't do that"" or ""stop-overpathogolizing yourself"" or anything along the lines of those.",2025-03-28 03:35:42,4,6,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1jlijci/so_umm/,umm,0.097,0.822,0.081,-0.748,unknown
1jo5mtm,am I the problem?,"Firstly i'm venting here but I would appreciate any advice/opinions

To give some context, I always try/am nice to people and try to make everyone I meet feel welcome and accepted. I always have the attitude I'll respect someone no matter their beliefs as long as they don't harm someone else and that I can be friends with someone even if they share different opinions to me. I've managed to go from a very anxious and introverted person to less socially awkward and manage to be myself with people. I'm well liked in my local community with people stopping to talk to me whenever I see them out and about. I think I have a good sense of humour and enjoy making people laugh but in the last week two different acquaintances have made two negative throwaway comments on me that offended me.

Firstly a colleague at work said I give off ""misogyny vibes"" and when I asked her what she meant she just laughed it off. This did offend me because i'm not a misogynist. I try to treat everyone equally and don't believe one gender is better than another. I tried to hide that this annoyed me because I have noticed she is quite a fake person who will gossip about people which I don't like and have challenged her on. But before this comment she had never made any negative comments about me at least to my face. I admit I don't always read people well and can be overly talkative so maybe I dominate conversations unknowingly but even then it doesn't happen with one gender more than the other and I don't mean any harm.

The only times I could think I potentially came across as misogynistic was when we had a conversation about how attractive men get away with bad things that I don't think other men would get away with. For example how Chris Brown has multiple allegations/evidence of abusing women and yet he's still extremely popular with his almost entirely female fans. And on another time this girl complained about men only finding women in the age 18-30 attractive, which I don't even think is true because there are plenty of attractive women who are older than that age group. But I stupidly tried to explain why biologically that is true and why socially it happens ie animals biologically want to reproduce and women in their 20s are most likely to be able to have children safely especially before the invention of modern fertility medicine and science. And then I said most men don't go for younger women but men with either money or good looks do because those are things that are attractive to lots of women. I don't think any of that's unfair to say and I didn't say I agree with it but just gave another perspective to a topic she thought up.

The second time was with someone I go to school with who I always thought highly of and seemed like a genuinely kind person who has never said something mean about anyone. The teacher said something pretty right wing and I joked about it and this girl laughed and said ""well you give off nazi vibes"" and then I asked her what she meant and she didn't explain so I laughed it off. This time I thought it was more likely to be a joke but it's still not something you want to hear ifykwim.

Then I thought about how over the years when I had a conversation with someone at a party or on a night out that I knew but never spoke to before and how people often remarked how ""your not actually a cunt you know"" or words to that effect.

Am I just being sensitive here? Also can someone explain what a vibe means because I've always felt that the term just allows someone to insult/give their opinion on someone whilst not having to stand on their word because they aren't directly accusing you of doing something or being something. eg saying someone gives fake vibes means they can say I never called you a liar but for all intensive purposes they did.",2025-03-31 18:17:06,3,3,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1jo5mtm/am_i_the_problem/,problem ?,0.081,0.743,0.176,0.9981,moderate
1jcxwlq,How to mentally get myself to be physically better,"Hi everyone,  

I’m posting here because I don’t know what else to do, and I’m hoping to find advice or encouragement from others who’ve been through this.  

I’m 140kg (5ft9, female), and I’ve struggled with my weight my whole life. But in the last decade—especially the last 4 years—I’ve gained an additional 25kg. I’ve hit a point where I hate being this size. I feel unhealthy, unhappy, and trapped in habits I know are harming me.  

Recently, I’ve started feeling the physical toll: my knees hurt when I walk, my lower back aches, and my feet feel like they’re carrying a heavy burden they can’t handle anymore. Even trying simple things, like walking, feels daunting.  

I work a retail job in a clothing store, which I don’t enjoy. It’s another area of my life where I feel stuck and unsatisfied.  

The hardest part for me is discipline—or really, the lack of it. In my head, I can picture what I’d like my life to look like. I map out plans to eat better, move more, and create healthier habits. But every day, I put it off: “Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.” And those tomorrows just keep piling up.  

I’ve tried before to make changes. I’ve gone weeks, sometimes even a month, sticking to better habits. But eventually, I quit. The cravings come back strong—sweets, fizzy drinks, junk food—and I give in. Chocolate gives me migraines, so I’ve managed to avoid it, but why can’t I stay away from everything else? I crave it constantly, and the worst part is that I feel awful after indulging.  

Even writing this is hard because I know I’m not healthy, I know I’m not in shape, and I know I’m not happy because of it. I just don’t know where to find the discipline or strength to break out of this cycle and stay on track.  

If anyone has been in a similar place or has any advice, I would really appreciate it. How do you find the motivation to stick to it when the cravings or doubts creep in? How do you stop putting it off?  

Thank you for reading this far. It means a lot.",2025-03-17 01:43:50,1,5,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1jcxwlq/how_to_mentally_get_myself_to_be_physically_better/,mentally get physically better,0.166,0.719,0.115,-0.9779,unknown
1jsd88p,"When you follow a self-help leader whose advice can't work for you... because they're a narcissist, and most of us are not","To be clear, I LOVE self-help. Also, I want to have a respectful attitude about people with narcissistic personalities; they have strengths; they have a place in this world like everybody.

I am just concerned, as a lifelong self-help fan, by the fact that narcissistic individuals are generally more likely to become influential, and they tend to market their self-help content as if it will work for you. In reality, a lot of their ""success"" is because of their narcissism that enables them to not doubt themselves, do whatever they want, and not be deterred by others. **Your success does not have to look the same as their success.**

Complicating this is the fact it seems rare for narcissists to become aware, much less open about it. Narcissism is very taboo. And it makes a person shut out any evidence of their flaws. **I have seen narcissistic leaders who I believe are very good-hearted, dedicated people and better than a lot of narcissists, yet their narcissistic traits do harm others and they are unable to see it.**

They lead you to believe that if you follow their ideas, you can glide through life with ease like they do.

But you can't. Self-help is individual. And you're likely someone who has a **healthy** level of self-doubt and deference to others. This makes you incapable of acting like your favorite leader.

I'm telling you this because I have idolized multiple self-help leaders over the years, whose teachings I now look at in a different light:

1. **Social freedom**: Self-help leaders are so good at setting boundaries, they're inspirational. Well, of course they are. ""Cutting toxic people out of your life"" is easy when you think the world revolves around you. I've realized that some people are actually *too* good at boundaries to where it starts to feel cold. **Tolerance for those I don't perfectly vibe with builds character!**
2. **Absence of self-criticism**: Have you ever looked up to someone who seemed immune to negative self-talk? They probably gave you advice for how you could retrain your mind. But narcissists don't seem to need much practice to block out thoughts of shame; they do it naturally. **I now embrace my shame like it's a friend. I appreciate how such feelings make me more accountable to others.**
3. **Channeling the divine in writing**: I was mesmerized by a self-help leader who wrote so effortlessly. She basically saw herself as channeling intuitive messages. She only lightly edited her words. **I finally realized I'm not divine, I'm human. And it's a good thing I want to fact-check my words and rethink my initial impulses, instead of writing exactly like her.**
4. **Creating your own reality**: Do you currently feel stuck in someone else's reality you don't like? If so, creating your own reality can be alluring. But note, feeling like a godlike creator is something narcissists are really good at. How do you feel about **co-creating a shared reality**? Lately, I'm leaning into that instead.

I feel like I'm in recovery from a lifetime of falling for narcissistic leaders.

I've been lucky enough to barely encounter narcissists in my actual personal life in person. But the ones I've idolized remotely have capitalized on my struggles.

I followed one leader who dismissed other people's diagnoses, as if conditions don't exist or are just a way of disempowering ourselves. But accepting myself as an autistic ADHD person has been liberating. I am not just a ""unique creator of my universe."" I *do* have limited potential. Loving my limits has made me more self-compassionate, and a better ally to others.

I would love to live in a world where narcissism is not so overrepresented in leadership.

**I want to live in a world where lots of our leaders are humble, modest, tolerant, deeply empathetic, and average.** I'm voting for that world by giving up on ""big"" self-help leaders and  embracing the wisdom of amazing everyday teachers—like the ones I find here on Reddit and in my personal life.",2025-04-05 23:45:54,2,2,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1jsd88p/when_you_follow_a_selfhelp_leader_whose_advice/,"follow selfhelp leader whose advice cant work ... theyre narcissist , us",0.056,0.738,0.205,0.9989,unknown

1jjatgr,How do I figure out who I am?,"The title says most of it but for more information, I don’t really know who or what I am and it’s getting to the point where it’s harming some of my relationships. I sometimes feel hollow or bland, like there’s nothing and no one inside me. I don’t really know what to do or even where to begin to figure out who I am. I don’t really have a sense of style, I can never come up with creative, artistic ideas, I don’t really do anything in my free time, and of the things I’m actually good at, I don’t really have access to any of them anymore (I used to throw for track and field but I don’t have anywhere to do that anymore). I don’t really know what my passions are and I don’t know how to figure them out.

1jgbkza,How do I stop this debilitating feeling of loneliness?,"Throwaway account.

I guess this is me venting but I want to have some sort of outlet.

I, M21, who is a gay 3rd year college student in Miami have been struggling with loneliness. I don’t mean superficially, but a loneliness that almost caused me to take my own life.

I’ve struggled with fitting in and having long term friendships for a long period of my life. I was apart of the problem in a decent bit of them, I must admit! But as I got older throughout late high school and especially all of my almost complete college years I’ve started to heal.

Heal any of my wounds, traumas, toxic/harmful coping skills, anything.

College was a wake up call and I dealt with two horrible situationships my freshman year. My sophomore year doesn’t get any better until I was about to leave to study abroad and I meet someone on tinder that goes to my school (let’s call him S). We ended up chatting everyday and met a few times, eventually dating.

Ironically, right before S and I officially dated— my first college situationship actually died. I hated him, but I was still heartbroken, and S got me through it and eventually we started dating. 

Then my first childhood dog passed away right before I leave the country. S was there for me, too.

I was so happy with him, even if he was thousands of miles away when I went abroad. He even came to visit me months later on his own accord. This is something my family would and could never do. For the first time in my life, I felt loved, supported, and like someone actually cared about me!!

The week after I returned back from my semester abroad, my other childhood dog passed away. S was there for me. The next week is when I return to school and S was there waiting for me. And then, without notice, he breaks up with me.  The relationship lasted about 5 months. The reasons he had broken up with me, is for reasons such as time management issues and for “being socially awkward” (??) which… I know is such a pathetic excuse. 

I spiraled for months after and reached rock bottom and even attempted to end my life many, many, times with so many close calls for the next 4 months. At first, it was because of the abrupt breakup and the fact that I was disposed of so easily, without any sort of care or concern after. For reference, my car battery died in front of his house at midnight when he broke up with me. I asked him if his roommates car can help jumpstart my battery; but he said no. I had to call roadside and get home alone—he never asked to see if I made it home safely.

But then, it eventually evolved into a deep, dark depression and feelings of horrific sense of loneliness; alone.

For example, a little over a month after my breakup I spent my 21st birthday all alone crying in a restaurant because nobody could show up. Could? Would? Idk. It got to the point where I would have to call the crisis hotline 2 or 3 times a day just to get through each and every day. Of course, during this time I had a therapist and psychiatrist, but they weren’t too helpful. I even lost some good friends during this time period—although looking back, maybe they weren’t real friends?

I would struggle and cry everyday feeling so alone. Even if I was going to classes, trying to complete my work, going to club meetings, and doing whatever I could to mitigate that feeling. Yet, it just was never enough. Most times I never had plans, and it felt like the few friends I had, I always initiated plans.

On top of balancing school, and moving 7 times a semester throughout my school campus—I genuinely had nothing in me anymore. Towards thanksgiving, every single day I was a ****** risk. I never talk to my family about it since I’m not close with them. I did not have a real support system and never really felt truly cared for. And yes, I am still trying to be “my own boyfriend” and even “my own support system.” There’s only so long you can do that before it breaks ya. :P

Somehow, I persevered. I completed my finals and realized I could not be alone and sad during winter break. To be honest, I don’t know if I would’ve made it, if I was…

The reason why I did “make it” was because after finals I traveled outside of the country to visit my friend. And wow, did I discover how happy I am when I travel. I got to explore so much, and it sparked my motivation to continue living.

Fast forward to 2025, I even go on a trip to Thailand I go out, meet new people, and I am the most carefree version of myself! I am so happy, and feel like I’m on top of the world. 

But when I return back to college in Miami, I become quite miserable. Even when it comes to making friends or meeting new people (romantic or not). I’ve gone on dates, hookups, whatever. I’m still stuck at trying to get anywhere—especially relationships. I should clarify I’m not seeking relationships on Grindr, but on hinge. Yet either app leaves me feeling rejected, or alone all over. I just deleted Grindr today over what felt like a really shitty meetup with another emotionally unavailable guy.

But no matter who I meet or whatever I do, I guess I’m not compatible with them or vice versa? I really try to be open, healthy, honest, and establish good boundaries. I’ve worked on myself and still continue to do so. Yet it feels like no matter how hard I try… it doesn’t do anything.

I’m on medication as well for the horrific depression and whatnot, but it’s been a few months and now I’m starting to get that dark feeling of loneliness again. In fact, I’m so exhausted to do anything. I feel paralyzed when it comes to executive functioning.

Sometimes I just come back to my dorm and cry because I’m so exhausted. I feel so alone every single day. I try to continue to go to job interviews, attend classes, go to club meetings—and even go out! But at the end of the night, I am alone in bed.

I have friends who have my location, sure. But one night, around a month ago today, I cried to my roommate and said, “even if I were to die in my room, I’m not sure how long it would take for someone to notice that I’m gone.”

Unfortunately, that still is true to today. I still don’t have a support system, and I feel cripplingly alone. I try to do meditations and allow myself to become independent. Yet, I think it simply delays the horrific thoughts.

I have tried about anything and everything. I’m at my Witt’s end, and I guess I don’t know how sustainable this is.
